Then why is she still sleeping?” I heard him say as he approaches and from how he sounded, I could tell that he would be in here soon.\\nCHAPTER 1 - JUST LIKE ALL OTHER MORNING\\nSCARLET’S POV\\n\\nI rolled on the mat one more time as I heard my name being called again. That was the usual practice, but today, they would have to come and get me themselves.\\n\\n“Where is that girl, what is she still doing on the bed by this time?” he screamed and cursed.\\n\\nI could tell that he was furious, but for now, I don’t care how he felt. So determined to pull through this, I remained on my bed with my eyes closed. I was ready for whatever punishment he would dish out this time.\\n\\n“Damn it, it is already 4:00 am and I have been up to some good this morning. Then why is she still sleeping?” I heard him say as he approaches and from how he sounded, I could tell that he would be in here soon.\\n\\nI heard the shattering sound of falling iron buckets followed by a scream from him. He must have hit his leg on one of the iron buckets littered on the passage leading to my room and I could tell it must have hurt him so badly as he continued to scream and curse at the buckets.\\n\\n“\\n\\nI have been awake even before three and had been rolling on my tattered mat ever since trying to fight off the giant mosquitoes that sang rough songs with terrible beats on my ear. Even my skin was not spared from their fierce attack as I wondered when all these would be over.\\n\\nAnyways, I am already used to this way of life. In fact, this is the only life that I know of even though I was living in the second largest mansion in the Diamond Cut Pack, with my own family. Yes, you heard me right, my own family.\\n\\nI barely slept for more than three hours after retiring by midnight. I always have to be awake in case I am needed by any one of them for even the most minute reason. A delay of an extra second on my part always resulted in extreme torture.\\n\\nBut this morning is just different for me. The weather is too cold and I think I need some more rest just as my sister, Dawn, was allowed to have.\\n\\nAnd so, I had vowed that unless I am dragged out of this old mat by them, I am going to get some extra rest.\\n\\nAs I unwillingly awaited his arrival, I cursed each one of them under my breath and I hoped that the pain he sustained from hitting the iron bucket never subside any soon.\\n\\n“What is she even still doing in bed by this time?” I could hear him yell again.\\n\\nI intentionally remained quiet and refused to answer as I would have done. What difference would that make anyway? Whether I answer his call or not, I was still going to get some terrible beating. And of course, I am aware that the torture I would receive for not answering would always be more, but at least that one is justified, so cut me some slacks.\\n\\n“Scarlet” he called. ” he cursed again.\\n\\nScarlet, Yes I am Scarlet. That was the name that my father, the beta of the Pack had given me as soon as he set his eyes on me.\\n\\nI was so frail to pass for his daughter and I was nothing compared to anyone of them. In fact, I was a disgrace to every one of them. So he did not care to give me a name that was common among my people, but Scarlet. When asked about the import of the name, he said he does not care whatever it meant. He however revealed to some that I was a danger to him.\\n\\n“You good for nothing, get out of this bed now” he shouted and emptied a bucket of water on me.\\n\\nThis was unexpected and I screamed when I felt the cold and harsh water on my skin. Every part of my body that the water touched went numb for the first few seconds before I was able to feel them again.\\n\\nNow I remember that I had stopped locking the door which was why I did not notice when he had entered my room. The lock of the door was of no good and even a single kick from a kid would bring it down so I figured that since it could not guarantee my safety, it was better to leave it open. And what was the use of a door that cannot protect? However, with the cold water splashed all over my body, I see the usefulness of even a useless door.\\n\\nNevertheless, since I had already vowed that if he wanted me, he must get me, I remained where I was with my whole body wrapped up and did not attempt to get up even after the cold water was poured on me.\\n\\n“Won’t you ever be useful in your life, you loser?” he screamed and threw the bucket at me.\\n\\nI screeched and rolled myself even more. My eyes were still tightly closed as I did not want to see what was coming for me.\\n\\n“You are always a disgrace” he cursed.\\n\\nYes, he was right. To everyone, I am a disgrace to the enviable family of Beta Tim. They are the strongest family in the Pack after the alpha and their offspring were the best but I am the direct opposite to all of those.\\n\\nIn anger, he used just one hand to drag me away from the mat and flung me in the air. I landed on the bare floor with my back and I screamed out in agony. At least, I wished to be lifted and now that I was, I have come to realize that it was not a very good wish.\\n\\n“Sam, I am sorry” I begged.\\n\\nI know what was coming next, no one needs to tell me. I have already infuriated him this morning and now he will make sure I pay a fair price for that.\\n\\nEvery single part of my body reflects the prizes that I have to pay for not living up to their expectations which as a result of my condition, was unattainable. The scars, the wounds, the pains, and the broken bone were all shreds of evidence of my predicament.\\n\\nMy predicament did not stop at that, it continued to my wolf which is completely different from every other regular wolf. My wolf could not assist my wounds to heal themselves like every other werewolf. It takes time to heal and still leaves some scars just like humans.\\n\\nNow you can see that Stake, my wolf is not just useless to everyone, but was of no value to me either. However, I loved it still because just like Mama Ruth, she was one person that expects nothing from me, she accepted me wholeheartedly just as I am.\\n\\n“You fool, why have you not been responding to my calls and what are you still doing sleeping by this time?” he asked in a fury.\\n\\nSam is the first child of my parents and they are two other boys after him. I am the fourth and when my mother was pregnant with me, everyone was happy that she was finally going to have a girl since the luna of our Pack had no female child. But I came and my appearance turned their joy into a living nightmare.\\n\\n“I didn’t hear you call, brother” I begged again.\\n\\nAddressing him as a brother further infuriated him. He had always hated to hear me do that and had never failed to show his displeasure. In fact, none of my family members wanted me to associate myself with them. They all wished that I never existed and they made sure to use every opportunity they get to pass the message to me.\\n\\n“Brother?” he walked up to me and without as much as giving it a second thought, he slapped me hard on my face.\\n\\n“No Sam, Sam, I mean to say Sam” I apologized and corrected myself as I held on to my hurting cheek.\\n\\nHe chuckled and looked at me with disdain, and his eyes filled with rage and he said. “Go look for your brother amongst fools and weaklings”\\n\\nHe smirked. I was shivering in fear, afraid of what might come next.\\n\\n“I would not want to get to the mansion before you\" he warned.\\n\\nBefore he left, he turned to me and said. \"Don’t worry, we would soon hand you over to a mate just as misery as you are. But we are even finding it difficult to get such a person. You are just so disgusting” he cursed.\\n\\n“Yo... you said…” I stammered.\\n\\nA mate? I just turned sixteen only a few months ago why are they already thinking of handing me away just yet, or am I that useless to them that they cannot even wait to discard me and why were they not decent enough to hide it?\\n\\nI had always believed that all these torments were going to end someday. I had hoped that one day they were going to see me as one of them and would apologize for all the wrongs that they had inflicted on me and then I was going to forgive them and we would all live as one big and happy family.\\n\\nBut no, they are not even sorry and it is now obvious to me that they would never be. Now they want to do even worse than they have always done, handling me over to just anyone without caring how I felt. They don’t care if I was going to love him or not.\\n\\nBut what I am even thinking? Did I for once believe that I was going to find love? From who and how? My own family doesn’t love me and no one ever does. Now I think that even I don’t love myself. Yes. So how would anyone accept such a weak and useless werewolf?\\n\\nOr maybe they are even doing me a favour. Finding someone might be the best for me because if I should grow older in this weak state, no man might ever find me attractive. And now, I have to start praying and hoping that my mate would find me worthy, or at least he would be less brutal than my own family.\\n\\n“That is to show you the trouble that you are putting us through. But you will never appreciate the sacrifices. You would never see the pains that we have to bear just because of you. You are just so ungrateful. Now we have to go through great pain to find you a mate. We have to beg for someone to accept you and we are even ready to pay if that is what it takes. But what do we get from you in return? Nothing but ingratitude. You are the ingrate here” he yelled.\\n\\n“I am happy and grateful for everything, Sam” I murmured.\\n\\nHe smirked. “So you always say, Scarlet, so you always say”\\n\\nHe walked out of the room and I ran steadily behind him because I must be right behind him when he gets to the mansion just as he had commanded if I don’t want to feel his wrath.\\n\\n“If you were any normal, now we should be thinking of mating you to the alpha” he murmured as he walked.\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 – NEVER SAY MOTHER\\nDAWN’S POV\\n\\n“You are of no use to me, you are just a loser” my mother screamed at Scarlet.\\n\\nI listened from where I was sitting with my friend, Gina. I hated it when she has to show face whenever I have my friends around. I don’t ever want to associate myself with her and I wished I could stop her from being my sister.\\n\\nThey were in the kitchen trying to make dinner while Gina and I sat at a corner munching some oranges.\\n\\nScarlet could not just do anything right and someone must be by her to watch her whenever she engages in any task. I find this gross. She is of no use to anyone, not even to herself. Even though she always claimed to have a weak wolf, I see her as being plain lazy and I wonder why my father was still keeping her even till now.\\n\\n“I am so sorry, mother” Scarlet replied.\\n\\nI raised my head to look at her. Did she just refer to my mother as mother? Without being told, I already know what was coming for her but I did not pity her one bit because she knows better than to ever try such.\\n\\nI was waiting to see my mother’s reaction and so was Gina. We both wished she could get what she had just asked for. As for me, I don’t care what becomes of her and I am indifferent about whatever happens to her but I would not tolerate her trying to establish a relationship with any member of my family.\\n\\nYes, she is my sister or so they say. But if there was one thing that I could change, it would be the womb that had carried her. And I am so glad and would forever remain indebted to my mother for never allowing her to suck her breast because the thought of her lips close to the same nipples that I sucked would have suffocated me.\\n\\n“What did I just hear you say?” my mother asked.\\n\\nGina made to get up angrily and go to Scarlet but I stopped her. My mum was in control of the situation and I was sure she would handle it properly.\\n\\n“Mother, I said that I am sorry, mother” she stammered.\\n\\nIt was already enough that I had to attend the same school as her and now she wants my mother too and even my whole family. Why must she always make me go through this torture?\\n\\nI could still remember the shame I had to live with when my fellow students addressed her as my sister. She was in the same class as me because her weakness wouldn’t let her start school the same year as her mates.\\n\\nBack then, every single day was a nightmare for me. And now that we are done with schooling, I would not want to share anything with her ever again. And if I can change the fact that I am living in the same house as her, I would gladly do that.\\n\\n“Get down on your knees this very minute” my mother instructed.\\n\\nShe quickly got down on her knees and tried to mumble some apologies.\\n\\n“I have always warned you against such but you will not listen. You never listen” my mother yelled.\\n\\nI could feel the anger emanating from my mother. She is furious and she did not attempt to hide it. But then, she is justified in being the way she is.\\n\\nScarlet had been corrected many times on how to address members of our family. She was to address me and my brothers by our names while she was instructed to add ma or sir to the names of our parents.\\n\\nNow, what was so difficult in what she was asked to do? Must she keep reminding us that we are family? This was the pain that we all want to forget and act like it was never there but all she does is rub it on our face at any slight opportunity.\\n\\nThe door opened and someone entered.\\n\\n“Madam Patricia, Beta Tim says you should meet him at his chambers”\\n\\nI turned around to see one of the omegas address my mother. This development made my spirit drop. I hated this omega for this. Why must he come at this very minute?\\n\\nGina grabs my hands and squeezes them. I knew she was as angry as I was or even more. I looked at her and smiled as I tried to assure her that this has not even started and so, it was not over yet. She mumbled some words to me revealing her displeasure.\\n\\nI knew my mum was not one to forgive easily so Scarlet was not free yet and I would like to be there when she finally gets what she deserved. So I shook my head at Gina assuring her that nothing was going to change.\\n\\n“I am right behind you,” my mother said to the omega that had come to call her and he left.\\n\\nMy mother made to go to the door and this brought disappointment to Gina and she squeezed my hands again and all I did was shake my head.\\n\\nScarlet, on seeing that my mother was on her way out made to stand but my mother turned back, went to her and slapped her with the back of her hands and this caused her to stumble for a few seconds before falling.\\n\\nWhen she was able to get hold of herself, she quickly got back on her kneel and mumbled some apologies to my mother.\\n\\n“Did I give you permission to get up, you ingrate?” my mother cursed.\\n\\n“Forgive my insolence, ma Patricia” Scarlet mumbled.\\n\\nI waited impatiently to see what would be the decision of my mother since Scarlet has apologized. I wanted my mother to show her no mercy for whatsoever reason.\\n\\n“I leave her to you. Do make sure to give her the right punishment she deserves” my mother instructed me before she left.\\n\\nThis was even better than we expected. Gina smirked as the instruction was all she needed to get right into action. She hated Scarlet even more than I do and this gladdened my heart and it showed that she was watching out for me, her friend.\\n\\nI love Gina and I love the fact that she hated Scarlet who had done nothing to her. A pain to me is a pain to Gina and so she needed no reason to despise Scarlet’s entire existence.\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 - FINDING A VOICE\\nSCARLET’S POV\\n\\nI felt a hot slap on my face, it was unexpected, so I stumbled and fell. But as soon as I could, I got up and went back on my knees. I didn\\'t know I had done something wrong and that was why I never expected such a reaction from her.\\n\\nI was still wondering what I might have done wrong when she yelled at me. “Did I give you permission to get up you ingrate?”\\n\\nShe has always been disgusted by my sight and she never tried to hide this hate. No one ever tried to hide this hate, not even the woman that had me in her womb for months.\\n\\nImmediately after she gave birth to me, she placed the omegas in charge of me and I had to live with them on the servant’s quarter right from my very first day on earth. So you see, I never know what life in the mansion felt like except for the numerous occasions when I had to run errands in the mansion just like now.\\n\\n“Forgive my insolence, ma Patricia” I mumbled.\\n\\nI saw her leaving and I had erroneously thought that it transcends to discharging me of the punishment from her.\\n\\nOf course, right? If she was going to leave that only meant I can get up. Why then was she angry when I did or was I supposed to remain on my knees till eternity?\\n\\nTruly, I find it just so difficult to understand these people I call my own. I don\\'t know how they do their logical calculations and arrive at their decisions. And whenever it appeared to me like I was beginning to understand them, they turn around and transform into something totally different from what I had gotten accustomed to.\\n\\nMy whole life, all I do was try to understand them and live up to their expectations. And doing this is even worse when compared to chasing shadows. They always ended up making me feel like an outcast even when all I tried to do was to love them.\\n\\nBut I am never going to stop, I appreciate all that they have done for me and so I will keep doing even much more to make them see me as an asset and value my place in their lives.\\n\\n“I leave her to you. Do make sure to give her the right punishment she deserves” my mother said.\\n\\nI felt shattered as I watch her leave and I turned to my sister and her friend and saw just how happy this instruction made Gina feel. She was just so happy to have me in her mercy and was not decent enough to conceal it.\\n\\nShe hated me more than everyone else even though I have done nothing against her to deserve such revulsion from her.\\n\\n“Now I have her” Dawn chuckled. She was elated as she walked up to me.\\n\\nDawn arrived a year after I was born. She is my younger sister and unlike me, she was everything the beta dreamt of in a daughter. In fact, she was even more. She was beautiful and was only fit for alphas and princes. Even though she tried not to admit it, I know she has a good heart, and deep down somewhere in her heart, she loved me just like a sister should.\\n\\nThe omega that was in charge of me, Mama Ruth, was kind enough to me and she saw that I went to school just like other kids but she could do nothing to ease my pains as even she too had her burdens.\\n\\nShe sent me to the same school as Dawn and even though I was a year older than her, we were in the same class because I did not start school together with my peers because of my slow growth and frailness.\\n\\nThe school I attended was for the children of the high and mighty and if it had not been under the management of the alpha which meant that I never had to pay for anything, I know that there was no way mama Ruth would have been able to afford such school for me since she received no extra penny from my parents to cater for me.\\n\\nThe children of the omegas do not attend the same school because of its high rate, but Mama Ruth felt that since I have lost in other things, I should benefit from schooling as children of the same social status as myself.\\n\\n“I am sorry, Dawn,” I pleaded in the hope that she would take pity on me and ask me to get up.\\n\\nBut instead of replying, she burst into re-echoing laughter and when she was done laughing, she said. “I am the one that should be sorry here. I am the one that had been made to put up with you all my life even when it was the most demeaning thing to ever happen to me”\\n\\nI would have loved to admit that she was right, but no, she has never suffered as a result of me. I am the one that was made to always clean up after her and even though I was her elder sister, I was taught never to question her authority. And all through my childhood, I never saw anything wrong with this arrangement until I began to understand life better.\\n\\nBut then, it was better I never did because I would not want to remember what my mother made me pass through on the very first day I had dared to put up a challenge against Dawn. Believe me, that day was hell.\\n\\n“But sis…”\\n\\nBefore I could complete my statement, Gina had already landed a thunderous slap on my face which sent me scampering blindly on the floor.\\n\\nI didn’t see her coming. The last I checked, she was sitting on the chair far from where I was kneeling. I was still trying to regain consciousness when Gina dragged me from where I was on the floor and forced me to go back on my knees.\\n\\n“Knee down you fool, who asked you to lie down?” Gina yelled.\\n\\n“Have mercy on her, Gina, you know she is not strong” Dawn said in a mocking tone.\\n\\n“Of course, she is not strong, and do you know I had almost forgotten that?” Gina replied and they started to laugh.\\n\\nMy legs were already weak and I was feeling numb on my knees. I could not kneel for long and I was already dizzy and feeling nauseated. If care is not taken, I might faint soon.\\n\\nDawn turned to me and said. “Since you are this weak why are you living among us? What are you doing among the strong? You should be in the forest with ants because that is where you belong”\\n\\nHer words hurt me really bad. I can get used to the hostilities from others but not from my sister who I love so much. I expect the same emotion from her. I want her to love me as much as I love her.\\n\\nI cannot live with the pain that I was feeling because of her. My heart was bleeding as I hear her utter those hurtful words. Maybe she was right. No, not maybe, I am a weakling and was not supposed to dwell among the strong.\\n\\n“Don’t bother yourself, Dawn, leave her to me, I will deal with her myself” Gina said.\\n\\nI smirked. Gina was threatening to deal with me. A girl that I was way older than. What right does she have to say such?\\n\\nHowever, I tried to hide just how furious I was. All I wanted was to get to Gina and tear Gina apart and then send her remains to her parents but for Dawn. She was Dawn’s friend and I know that doing that would hurt Dawn which is something that I will never do intentionally.\\n\\nBut no, I have no chance against Gina. I am a weakling remember? So I can’t face Gina even if I wanted to. I sulked at my predicament.\\n\\n“Just with one finger, I am going to destroy you. No, I don’t even need to lift a finger, I will turn you to shreds by just the word of my mouth” she grinned.\\n\\nI looked at her, feeling irritated by her person and she looked back at me scornfully.\\n\\n“And what do you want to do? Imbecile, that is what you are, you are an imbecile” she said.\\n\\nI don’t how I did it or what made me do it but I rose to my feet and charged at her.\\n\\nShe never expected such a reaction from me and so she was in the least prepared for what came for her. I had never stood up to her before and she believed I would not even do that now.\\n\\nI screamed as I grabbed her by the throat and tried to strangle her. I don’t care if she dies or what would happen to me after this but I would make sure I gave her a dose of her own bitter pills.\\n\\nShe screamed in shock and tried to pull me away from her body but could not. She rotated and dragged me away from her body and flung me so hard on the floor.\\n\\nI fell and tried to open my eyes but I could not see anything. Everywhere was dark and I could only detect some tiny sparkling stars. I tried to get up immediately and charge towards her again but I could barely lift my body as I wanted to.\\n\\nEven though it was almost impossible for me to do what I wanted, I was resilient and persistent.\\n\\nAt last, I was able to drag myself up from the floor and made to go for Gina with all the hate in me.\\n\\nI think I was still running towards her when I heard one of them say. “Are you sure she is still alive, Gina?”\\n\\n“What difference does that make? it is not like you have ever wanted her” the other reply.\\n\\nHearing their voices made me realize that I have fainted.\\n————————————\\n💋Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here\\nInstall the APP to search for the book title 👉\"LUNA BETWEEN ALPHAS\" 👈Read more exciting content immediately', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n💋Clicks to read book 👉\"LUNA BETWEEN ALPHAS\"\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 2466, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 910, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:03:00', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Bats and jackals, bears and cats. Vampires, so unnatural in their beauty and strength. But none are more powerful than the wolf shifters. With both instinct and human intelligence, so intertwined with nature and humankind itself, we are more of this earth than you are.\\n\\nI don’t remember much of my mother or pack, but I remember her stories of our kinds’ abilities and the enemies that plague us. Not wholly evil, and not entirely good, those tales haunted my nightmares and dreams alike for years after I was too old for bedtime stories and forgot my mother’s face entirely.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 1\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI awoke that morning with a twisting knot of anxiety in my stomach. I rolled onto my side under the covers and clung to my pillow tightly before heaving in a deep breath and getting up. Today was my eighteenth birthday. Today, I would find my mate.\\n\\nStanding up I examined myself in the mirror, frowning at the spindly pale girl gazing back at me. I wondered if a mate would reject their match based on looks alone. I pulled my hair up into a ponytail before exhaling through my nose and letting it fall loose around my shoulders again.\\n\\nThe bright red locks only made me look paler. I could sense my mate, it seemed they were nearby.\\n\\nIf they didn’t come looking for me there was a good chance I would find them first - their scent almost palatable on my tongue. Already my inner-wolf seemed to crave them, rearing to seek them out. Whoever it was.\\n\\nI could sense something odd about my new mate. While all the desire and enthrallment were present on my side, something about their energy felt off. Things were off to a great start, I thought, tensely pulling at a strand of hair.\\n\\nDespite my nervousness, I couldn’t help the excitement bubbling up inside my chest. I had waited for this day since I had been old enough to understand the mating call. I had wanted this day since I was old enough to want for anything. To be wanted…\\n\\nI was snapped out of my pondering by a quiet knock on my bedroom door. Anita, my current caretaker poked her head in and gave me a small smile.\\n\\n“Today’s the day,” Anita didn’t step into the room - the relationship too short and unfamiliar for affections of any kind, “Are you excited?”\\n\\nI turned back to the mirror and glowered at my reflection.\\n\\n“More like sick to my stomach. What if they don’t like me?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” Anita tutted, brushing the air, “Whoever it is, they’re your mate. And besides, you’re a beautiful girl on top of all that spunk of yours.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile a little. Passed around from foster home to foster home, I had only known Anita for a little over a month at that point, but her kind words eased my quivering nerves slightly.\\n\\nAnita promised to whip up an extra special breakfast - “waffles and hashbrowns!” - before leaving me to get ready for college.\\n\\nAlone and overwhelmed again, I was torn between putting on my best outfits and attempting some kind of make-up endeavor, or treating today like any other day and donning my regular jeans and turtleneck.\\n\\nIn the end, I went for my standard attire with some added rings and necklaces to convey some sort of actual effort.\\n\\nLastly, I swept my fiery hair into a rough braid and pinned the loose wisps back with a collection of different colored clips. After forcing down a bite or two of steaming waffle I assured Anita I would have the rest when I returned and headed out to campus.\\n\\nThe local college was a ten-minute walk from my current home and I spent the entire trip going over introductions in my head.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I’m your mate.”\\n\\nSounded way too formal.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it to campus, I was a quaking bundle of nerves. I wasn’t even entirely sure that my mate went to this college. Although considering it was the only college attended by every young wolf-shifter of the nearby packs, it was highly likely.\\n\\nOn top of that, my inner-wolf grew even more agitated the second I stepped inside. My mate was close, I could smell the hint of pine and englewood in their scent.\\n\\nBefore I had half a chance to look, it was time to head to class. I spent the first hour relentlessly gnawing on the end of my pen and meticulously fiddling with my braid until the whole thing looked like a frazzled mess. All the while running through various introductions to no avail.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I think I’m your mate?”\\n\\nToo timid. I groaned loud enough to startle the dozing boy sitting next to me and plopped my head down onto the desk in defeat.\\n\\nAfter two more hours of barely containing my growing excitement, I was finally free to stalk the campus, following the comforting scent of my soon-to-be mate.\\n\\nI kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the other students who jostled around me in the corridors. I wasn’t particularly popular at this school and people passed me by like I was invisible.\\n\\nThe scent was stronger now, I knew my mate was close. Turning a corner I shivered in anticipation. My legs felt like jelly and my small bites of breakfast were threatening to crawl back up my throat. Then, suddenly, there he was. I knew he was my mate the second I lay eyes on him.\\n\\nHe was leaning against the wall in front of me, flipping through a stack of notes like he didn’t know what else to do with himself. Johan, a gentle Beta of the Kall Pack - it was very likely that he didn’t know of me at all. But I knew him. I was also uncomfortably aware that his girlfriend was the prettiest she-wolf in their pack.\\n\\nI was stunned. I stood there for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the boy in front of me. He hadn’t noticed me yet - but surely he could sense me?\\n\\nJohan ran a hand through his hair - short wavy locks the color of wheat - and continued flipping through pages with a furrowed brow. My courage failing me, I took a small step back.\\n\\nMy inner-wolf raged in response but my mind was suddenly flooded with doubt. Why couldn’t he sense my presence? Maybe he could, but didn’t want to acknowledge me. Surely he would leave his girlfriend now that it was clear that I was his true mate? I took another step back into the shadows of the hallway, preparing to leave.\\n\\nSuddenly, Johan raised his head and looked straight at me. Gentle brown eyes locked with mine and he gave a half-smile that accentuated the dimple in his cheek. Overwhelmed and caught off guard, I turned tail and sprinted back down the way I’d come.\\n\\nIt was all too much. I couldn’t think straight. A million thoughts shot through my mind as I ran, my sneakers squeaking on the laminated floors.\\n\\nJohan was perfect. He was soft and kind and absolutely gorgeous. But he wasn’t mine. Fighting back tears as I made my way to the bathrooms, rushing into a cubicle and slamming the door shut behind me.\\n\\nI pressed my forehead to the cool concrete of the stall and tried to organize my thoughts. Johan was my mate - Johan knew that I was his. He had to. But Johan also had a girlfriend - Mavis - someone who was miles ahead of me in terms of looks, status, and charisma. Mavis who, along with her posse of beautiful airheads, had bullied me since I had joined their pack as a kid.\\n\\nI slid to the floor and put my head on my knees. I thought I would be ready for this day. Today was supposed to be perfect. Today I was supposed to finally belong somewhere.\\n\\nA few treacherous tears escaped and slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away roughly and sniffed. A sudden knock on the cubicle door had me jumping in my skin.\\n\\n“Um, Dorothy?”\\n\\nA quiet voice from the other side, a voice like milk and honey, “Hey, um, Dorothy could you come out here? I promise I won’t bite.”\\n\\nI could hear the grin in Johan’s voice at that last part. His scent, so close and comforting, enveloped me. Hesitantly, I got to my feet, wiping my teary eyes on my sleeve, and opened the door slightly. I peaked out at the boy standing at the door, and he chuckled at my dramatic pouting.\\n\\n“Geez, you run away and frown at me before we’ve even been properly introduced?”\\n\\nHis words were chiding but his tone was light and there was a humorous glimmer in his eye. I swung the door fully open and came to stand in front of him. I stared down at my shoes, hoping he wouldn’t notice my reddened eyes.\\n\\n“I just… didn’t know what to say.”\\n\\nI still didn’t, really. Standing before this beautiful boy, my true mate, all of my confidence went out the window along with my ability to form sentences.\\n\\n“Well, we can start slow,” Johan offered me his hand, “Would you mind if we talk somewhere else? As much as I’d love to hang around the girl’s bathroom I don’t think the ladies will be particularly happy with my being here.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took Johan’s hand and let him guide me out of the bathroom and through the throngs of students towards the small indoor garden.\\n\\nHe sat down on the creaking wooden bench and gestured for me to join him. I plonked down next to him and immediately berated myself mentally for not even trying to be graceful. Johan didn’t seem to mind though and he leaned back on the bench, folding his arms and cocking his chin to gaze at me.\\n\\n“So… my name is Johan-”\\n\\nI couldn’t help a short laugh, cutting him off, and waved my hand to dismiss his introduction.\\n\\n“I know who you are. Everyone here knows who you are. You’re the pack’s golden boy with the bombshell girlfriend and a father on the council. I would have been living under a rock all this time if I didn’t know your name.”\\n\\nJohan smirked and raised an eyebrow at me. “Okay, my reputation precedes me, it would seem.”\\n\\nI breathed a quiet sigh of relief that my interruption didn’t seem to offend him.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Johan continued, “You’re Dorothy right? I’ve seen you around campus a few times,” He laughed at my incredulous expression, “Your hair is a little hard to miss.”\\n\\nI blushed brighter than my locks at that comment and twisted my braid between my fingers. We spoke for a while, I explained that I had been moving between foster homes since I’d been left with the pack as a small child.\\n\\nJohan told me about his father’s strict parenting that landed him with his “golden boy” persona in the first place.\\n\\nAs we talked, I felt myself begin to relax, comfortable in Johan’s calm presence. The excitement I had felt earlier that morning was back and I couldn’t help but smile openly while speaking with my true mate.\\n\\nJohan spoke with a laid-back, boyish attitude and waved his hands around while describing how he and an old friend had once been chased around the woods by a jackal they’d mistaken for a wolf-shifter when they were children.\\n\\nI in turn gave him a dramatic retelling of the story about a pet frog I’d once had and how it had gotten into one of my caretaker’s handbags on their big, fancy date night.\\n\\nAfter a while, Johan’s tone grew more serious and he took my hand in his. I felt prickles of electricity where his skin touched mine and I looked into his chocolate brown eyes in earnest. This was it. He was going to accept me as his mate.\\n\\nI could barely contain my excitement and I could feel my inner-wolf singing in my chest. Johan’s expression, however, was puzzling - almost sympathetic.\\n\\n“Dorothy, you’re beautiful. You’re ‘perfect’. I can feel the connection we have and I know now that you are my true mate. You always have been. But…” he hesitated - wincing like the words hurt to force out, “But I already love someone else - Mavis, her and I… we promised we’d stay together.”\\n\\nIt felt as if a carpet had been pulled from beneath my feet but instead of the ground, there was only open space. I pulled my hand away from Johan even though it pained me to do it.\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\nMy voice cracked slightly, and my eyes pricked with tears once more.\\n\\nJohan’s face contorted as he fought to keep his voice steady, “Dorothy...”\\n\\nI leaned away from him, shaking my head and covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to hear it. I couldn’t. Johan took my face in his hands, using a thumb to wipe a tear that was trailing down my cheek.\\n\\n“Dorothy, I can’t accept you as my mate. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nJohan held onto me as I burst into tears, burying my face in his chest and soaking in his scent while I still could.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 2\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nIt was a long while before my wailing petered out into quiet sobs. I leaned into Johan who had his arms around me, stroking my hair and cradling my shaking frame. I inhaled against his neck and clutched the fabric of his shirt with trembling hands.\\n\\n“Please, don’t reject me yet. Not today.”\\n\\nMy voice was hoarse, a little more than a whisper as I clung to him, “Let me at least have today, even if it’s fake.”\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom a rejection so monumental. Not here, alone on campus where everyone could witness the aftermath. And not today - it was too much to bear.\\n\\nJohan was silent for a moment, rocking me gently as he thought it over.\\n\\n“Alright. Not today.”\\n\\nHe squeezed my shoulders tightly before releasing me and standing up, “I should get going. Again, I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nHe reached out as if to touch my hair, but drew his hand away abruptly, shoving it into his pocket instead. Turning with jerky movements, Johan left the garden and disappeared into the bustling corridor without another word.\\n\\nI stared after him, motionless and empty. My inner-wolf cried in anguish deep inside of my chest. I felt numb, my tears used up, and what little hope I had left was shattered entirely.\\n\\nA part of me wanted to scream and cry for Johan to come back. To beg him to stay. But I was exhausted, and the small voice in the back of my mind was whispering that I shouldn’t have expected anything else. That I would never be wanted. That I would never belong.\\n\\nHeaving myself off the bench, I left the garden on legs that felt like lead. The thought of more classes after what had just happened was unbearable. I slipped out of the college instead and headed towards the woods just outside of campus. Going home wasn’t an option either.\\n\\nAlthough Anita would be understanding, her sympathetic smile would only make me feel worse. In that moment, I just wanted to be alone. I scuffed my sneaker on the tarmac and inhaled the fresh scent of the woods before me. Pine and Engelwood, just like him. I pushed the thought from my mind.\\n\\nBefore I could make it to the woods, however, I heard multiple sets of footsteps catching up behind me and turned to see five of Mavis’s crew heading my way. Why now?\\n\\nI contemplated running, but among the group, I’d spotted Lana, who, with her long slender limbs and athletic abilities had always managed to run me down before.\\n\\nI didn’t see this time going any differently. Instead, I slowed my pace and let them catch up with me, forming a half-circle between their prey and the forest. I folded my arms and prepared to defend myself.\\n\\n“Hello, gingersnap, what has you running out here with your tail between your legs?” Claudia, the speaker in question, donned a malicious fake smile while she blinked at me.\\n\\n“Well hello Claudia, why don’t you mind your own business for once?” I sneered back, “Doesn’t Mavis need her guard dogs today?”\\n\\nI hoped they couldn’t hear the tremble in my voice. Hoped they wouldn’t notice my puffy eyes and tear-streaked face.\\n\\nHatred flashed in Claudia’s eyes and she prodded my chest with one perfectly manicured nail, “I heard somebody found her mate today,” she said in a sing-song voice and poked me again, harder this time.\\n\\nI smacked her hand away. “That’s got nothing to do with any of you.”\\n\\nCladia retracted her clawed hand and coked her head to the side. “Oh, but it does. I heard you were getting quite cozy with Johan over in the gardens earlier. And Alissa said she even saw the two of you leave the bathroom together. Didn’t you Alissa?”\\n\\nShe looked over at the bottle blonde to her left who shrugged and nodded vaguely like the entire conversation disinterested her.\\n\\n“It’s not what you think, he doesn’t even want -” My words came out jumbled and I cut myself off, unable to voice the painful truth.\\n\\nClaudia made no effort to conceal the joy this torment brought her. A cold grin settled across her face. “He doesn’t want you.”\\n\\nWith that, I decided I had had enough. I pushed past the tall girl and made for the canopy of the forest. Claudia clearly wasn’t letting me go that easily though and she gripped my shirt at the shoulder, yanking me backward and sending me to the ground before I could steady myself.\\n\\nClaudia was strong. Inhumanly strong. She was using the strength of her inner-wolf and she was all the more dangerous for it.\\n\\nI landed on my back and immediately tried to scramble to my feet only for Claudia to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach with her pointed boot. I buckled, winded, and collapsed to my knees. I had no time to gasp for air before Lana delivered another kick to my side, and sent me sprawling on the tarmac again.\\n\\nClaudia reached down, grabbing my hair, and yanked my head up to face the girls. “We couldn’t care less about you or who you decide to pine over. But you got a little too close to Mavis’s man and we can’t allow that.”\\n\\nWith that, she slammed my head against the ground causing stars to explode across my vision and blood to pour from both my nose and a nasty new gash in my brow. The girls continued their assault, taunting and jeering while I curled up on my side in an attempt to protect myself.\\n\\nI could barely think straight, my mind was foggy and I cried out at every jab and kick that hit its mark. It felt like they were aiming to kill. I had endured their torment time and time again but this time they weren’t holding back.\\n\\nThe attack went on for what felt like forever when suddenly, through the fog I heard a new voice speak up.\\n\\n“What the fuck is going on here?”\\n\\nA voice so low and dangerous. A voice like ice.\\n\\nThe girls halted their attack and a new scent washed over me - overpowering and intoxicating, it was a musky rose with the echo of a sea breeze. I couldn’t see this new stranger from my fetal position on the ground but I could sense him with every fiber of my being.\\n\\nThe hair on my neck rose and my heart slowed into deep rhythmic beats that reverberated through my entire body.\\n\\n“Who are you supposed to b-” I heard Lana start before she was abruptly cut off by Claudia.\\n\\n“Let’s go. Now.”\\n\\nThere was genuine fear in her voice.\\n\\nI could hear them hurry away, and unfolded myself to catch a glimpse of the stranger who’d saved me. The blood from the wound to my head had dripped down into my eyes and made it difficult to see. I squinted in the direction of the dominating scent and feebly rubbed at my eyes.\\n\\nStanding over me was a boy whose appearance matched the tone of his voice. Cold, and unsettling. His hair was snow white and ruffled like it was caught in a perpetual gust of wind. Dark brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes that were gazing down intently at me.\\n\\n“Who - argh!” I tried to get to my feet but a sharp fiery pain in my side kept me down.\\n\\n“Try not to move too much.” The stranger knelt down and slid a hand between my head and the rough ground, “Looks like they did a number on your ribs.”\\n\\nI winced as he tilted my head slightly to examine the bleeding cut, “Didn’t go easy on your face either,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nI groaned as another sharp pain shot through my side. The bleeding from my nose had slowed but there was no doubt that I looked like a god-awful mess.\\n\\n“Someone should see to that. Do you think you can stand?”\\n\\nThe stranger frowned as I tried to get to my knees and failed miserably, clutching my side and moaning in frustration.\\n\\n“Guess not. Why did those girls have it out for you anyway?” he asked while slinging my arm over his shoulder and lifting me to my feet. He went a step further and swung an arm under my knees, lifting me off the ground and cradling me in his arms.\\n\\nHe took care to be gentle around my aching ribs and headed back towards the college campus. Too tired and injured to be embarrassed, I rested my head against his chest - a chest like warm marble.\\n\\n“They’ve never really needed a reason to do what they do.”\\n\\nI didn’t feel like explaining the truth. I had had enough humiliation for one day without explaining my mate’s rejection to an odd stranger. The answer seemed satisfying enough to him though as he shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n“Typical. Anyway, we need to get you to a doctor. Make sure nothing is broken.”\\n\\n“Hmm.”\\n\\nI was only half-listening, fatigue catching up with me after the events of the day. On top of that, I found I was quite enjoying this boy’s strange scent.\\n\\nAnother wave of pain snapped me out of my trance and I swiveled my head to gaze up at the guy’s face. From this angle, his jawline looked like the edge of a cliff. Everything about him seemed sharp enough to cut.\\n\\n“Who exactly are you?” I asked tentatively. I’d never seen him around before. I was sure I would have remembered a face like that.\\n\\n“Ignatius. I’m from the Allied Pack further North but my father is down here for an Elders meeting. Thought I’d tag along and visit some old friends.”\\n\\nHe glanced down, raising one dark eyebrow at me, “And who are you, little Miss five-on-one?”\\n\\nHis gaze had my stomach twisting in knots and my inner-wolf was stirring in response to this new anomaly. I forced my suddenly gaping mouth closed and looked away.\\n\\n“I’m nobody special.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange name.”\\n\\nHis tone was somehow flat and slightly amused simultaneously. I glowered at his small smirk, wiping my nose where fresh blood was drizzling out.\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy. I’m a part of this area’s pack but not really. And this morning I had waffles and syrup for breakfast.”\\n\\nI turned my nose up and faced away from him again, determined to not share any more of my incredibly mundane current life.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of silent walking and being carried around like a sack of delicate potatoes, I asked, “Do you, like, have a car, or do you plan to walk us to the hospital?”\\n\\nWithout answering, Ignatious rounded the corner with me and fished a set of car keys out of his pocket. Striding up to a flashy, old-school Impala, he unlocked the passenger door and stooped to put me down.\\n\\nBefore he could manage that, however, we were interrupted. A comforting scent, the slightest hint of pine in the air.\\n\\n“Dorothy?”\\n\\nIgnatius turned with me in his arms to face Johan, standing a few feet away.\\n\\n“Dorothy, what happened to you?”\\n\\nGenuine concern in his voice, he seemed as gentle as ever but there was tension in his shoulders and his lips twitched slightly as he eyed Ignatius and his pale arms firmly handling me.\\n\\n“Johan,” Ignatius said nonchalantly, while my head snapped up to look at him so fast I damn near gave myself whiplash, “Long time no see, old friend.”\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 3\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\n“You know each other?” I squeaked, clinging tighter to Ignatius now that Johan’s scent was present and toying with my emotions once again.\\n\\nNeither responded to my question but instead, Johan stepped closer, reaching for me, stiltedly like he couldn’t control his movements. My internal heartbreak still fresh, I cowered away from him into Ignatious’s chest.\\n\\n“I’m okay. Really it’s fine.”\\n\\nI was fighting to keep my tone even but my voice shook slightly.\\n\\n“Um, Ignatious is just helping me out.”\\n\\nIgnatius himself seemed confused by the odd interaction between Johan and me, but thankfully he caught on to the fact that the situation was more than uncomfortable. He proceeded to place me gently in the passenger seat and straightened up to face Johan again.\\n\\n“She was attacked by some students. Gonna take her down to the healer to fix her up.”\\n\\nIgnatius tried to close the passenger door behind him but Johan put a hand out to stop him. He seemed to be wrestling with himself internally, his shoulders shaking and his hands curling to fists.\\n\\n“I should… come with you.”\\n\\nHe spoke with uncertainty, most likely his inner-wolf was fighting for its true mate. He stared down at me huddled on the passenger seat, a possessive glint in his previously soft eyes. I shook my head, silently.\\n\\nThe instinctual part of me wanted him to stay close and I didn’t have the strength to tell him no. I glanced at Ignatious - pleading with my eyes for him to handle the situation swiftly. He gave me a small nod and put a warning hand on Johan’s shoulder.\\n\\n“She’ll be fine, you can visit her later if you need to.”\\n\\nFor a second it looked like Johan would get violent, glancing angrily at the cool hand on his shoulder. Ignatius removed his hand and folded his arms, “Isn’t Mavis going to be wondering where you are?”\\n\\nThis seemed to shake Johan out of his volatile state. He stepped away and allowed Ignatius to close the passenger door. With one final glance in my direction he turned and left, heading back into the college and rubbing an arm over his eyes.\\n\\nIgnatius stared after him for a while before rounding the car and climbing into the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n“Put your seatbelt on.”\\n\\nIt took me a moment or two to realize he was obviously talking to me. I turned my gaze from the window and Johan’s retreating figure to face my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“Uh, potentially fractured rib cage?”\\n\\nI didn’t mean for it to sound quite so condescending but the interaction with Johan and my still aching body had left me in a sour mood. Ignatius started the car and pulled out of the parking bay.\\n\\n“Fair point. Here, for your face.”\\n\\nHe handed me a towel from the back seat and I pressed it to my dripping nose. The rest of the car ride was a silent one, albeit not wholly unpleasant. Ignatius’s scent was as comforting as it was intoxicating.\\n\\nThe salty tint of a sea breeze was detectable even through a nose clogged with blood. He flicked on the radio at some point and I closed my eyes, leaning back in the seat and allowing myself to drift pleasantly into unconsciousness.\\n\\n~Johan~\\n\\nTearing myself from Dorothy had been more difficult than I expected. Walking back into college I made straight for an empty lecture room and slammed the door behind me, harder than I had intended to - the wood splintered slightly and it creaked on its hinges in protest.\\n\\nPlanting my palms on an empty desk I ran through the events of today in my head. I had been able to sense her from the moment I awoke that morning. As much as I had believed I was ready for the mating call, her floral scent was overpowering.\\n\\nWaiting in the hallway earlier while she hesitated to approach me, I felt as if I was standing in an open field. She smelled of fresh air and sprawling pastures, lavender, and light rain. My inner-wolf craved her as I fought to keep my head down, scanning the notes gripped in my fists without actually reading anything.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes from her for long but I was scrambling desperately for the right words to say. I hadn’t expected her to run away, although I couldn’t really blame her.\\n\\nStanding there and pretending that every cell in my body wasn’t singing for her, I couldn’t have given the best first impression.\\n\\nDorothy was perfect though. Talking to her up close - holding her - I could have betrayed Mavis then and there. But we had promised; if Mavis was not my true mate and she wasn’t mine, we would reject our mates and stay together.\\n\\nA duo for years, we had spoken about this day, even as children. When I was nine I crafted her a ring made of twigs and dandelions and swore that one day I would marry her. I loved Mavis, I always would. I couldn’t abandon her for a mate I had only known for half a day.\\n\\nAnd then there was Ignatius. I knew he’d be coming to visit, our fathers had been fast friends for years and Ignatius and I were essentially brothers. Why then would he be hanging around Dorothy? Why would he be holding her? Why was she so eager to go with him?\\n\\nFurthermore, she’d been bleeding. Did he hurt her? How dare he lay a finger on my mate. Friend or no friend I wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart if he so much as -\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with my index finger and thumb. I had let my inner-wolf dictate my emotions. I felt possessive and infuriated at another man near my true mate. But Dorothy wasn’t mine to possess - I had told her so myself.\\n\\nObviously, Ignatius didn’t know about the mating bond, he was just helping out a girl he’d met. And Dorothy had every right to be wary of me, I’d given her nothing but mixed signals and a terrible birthday. I felt torn, tormented. It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult.\\n\\n“So this is where you’ve been hiding.”\\n\\nI hadn’t heard anyone enter, but Mavis was standing behind me with folded arms.\\n\\nShe wore a flowing green sundress and a frown on her face. She waltzed up beside me and hoisted herself onto the desk, swinging her legs beneath her.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you.”\\n\\nI came to stand in front of her and she opened her legs to welcome me. Leaning forwards, I buried my face in her neck and inhaled the scent of her skin and brilliant blonde locks. She smelled of conditioner and expensive fragrance.\\n\\nI didn’t mind the fake floral odor though. I needed reassurance. I needed to remind myself that this was the right decision.\\n\\nMavis ran her fingers through my hair.\\n\\n“So you found her.”\\n\\nHer plump lips brushed my ear.\\n\\n“Your true mate?”\\n\\nI wrapped my arms around her. I wanted to melt into her, assimilate into one being that had no true mate and no mating call to deny. “Yeah. How did you know?”\\n\\nShe blew a raspberry on my neck. I knew she was rolling her eyes without needing to see them.\\n\\n“Allisa obviously. Said she saw you two in the bathroom. And the garden. She said you were holding her.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a moment, waiting for me to deny it. I tightened my embrace and squeezed my eyes shut.\\n\\n“It wasn’t like that. I was honest and she was hurt, I was just trying to be nice.”\\n\\nMavis pulled away and looked me in the eye.\\n\\n“Did you reject her?”\\n\\nIt was hard to keep eye contact. I had never been able to lie to her and this time was no different. I cupped her delicate face in my hand, “Not exactly…”\\n\\nMavis pulled away again and moved to stand up.\\n\\n“Not entirely,” I continued, “But I told her I couldn’t be with her. I love you, Mavis -” I gripped her waist, holding her in place, “I love you.”\\n\\nHer green-gray eyes were piercing and angry, her lips twisted into a sneer, “Then why didn’t you reject her?” she hissed.\\n\\nI straightened up and pressed my palms to my eyes in frustration.\\n\\n“She asked me not to do it today. She was crying, Mavis. What difference does it make if I do it tomorrow instead?”\\n\\nMavis slid off of the desk and stood before me. She pounded a fist on my chest.\\n\\n“You don’t want to reject her, do you? You selfish prick, you can’t ignore the mating call. All of your promises were a bunch of lies.”\\n\\nShe was shorter than me but it felt like she was towering above me, her words like daggers.\\n\\n“Just admit it. You don’t want to ignore it because you’re weak!”\\n\\nI gripped both her wrists in my hand and pressed her fingers to my lips. “I’ll do it, okay? I’ll reject her. You just need to give me some time.”\\n\\nMavis narrowed her eyes and regarded me coldly. She jutted her chin out and yanked her hands away, “I’m the only one who understands you. Not your dad, not your friends, not her. I’m all you’ve got.”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\nI lowered my head, I just wanted it all to be over. This day, this argument, my feelings towards Dorothy. All of it.\\n\\n“I’m the only person who truly cares about you,” Mavis continued, “Who stood by you all these years? Me, I did. I charmed your father, I got along with your useless friends. I got you the status you have today.” She brought her face up to mine and gripped my chin, forcing me to look her in the eye, “Without me you’re nothing.”\\n\\nI knew I shouldn’t let her talk to me like that, but she was right about everything. We needed each other. We had always taken care of each other.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Besides,” Mavis moved her hand to caress my cheek, her eyes softening slightly, “She could never love you like I can.”\\n\\nShe pressed her lips to mine and lassoed her arms around my neck. I leaned into her kiss, convincing myself that if I could just stay close to her, everything would be alright. Mavis pulled me towards her as she backed up against the desk.\\n\\nLost in the moment and determined to push Dorothy out of my mind completely, I hoisted Mavis up onto the desk and she wrapped her slender legs around me. She knotted her fists in my hair and kissed me passionately.\\n\\nI let my hands wander and gripped her thighs under her dress, relishing in the taste of her tongue pushing into my mouth. She pulled at my jeans and moaned for more.\\n\\nWhen I finally pushed into her she sighed into my ear, “Don’t leave me. Promise me you won’t leave me.”\\n\\nI threw my head back in pleasure as she slid her tongue along my neck before kissing her again.\\n\\n“I won’t. I promise.”\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 4\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI was in the woods, standing in a clearing under the silver light of a full moon. I felt safe there at first, bathed in that brilliant glow. I heard something stirring in the darkness of the trees in front of me. Something dangerous.\\n\\nThe slightest hint of a scent was carried to me by the breeze that hushed through the dark and silent forest. The scent of Engelwood and pine. The creature in the dark was approaching. I heard the underbrush rustling as it slowly stalked closer.\\n\\nAll of my senses screamed for me to run, but I was rooted to the spot. I peered into the shadows, trying to catch a glimpse of the unknown being.\\n\\nI glanced down at a sudden sharp movement in my stomach. Something in there wanted to get out. Distracted momentarily by my own body, I looked up again just in time to see the creature with open jaws lurching for my throat.\\n\\nI jerked my body upright as I awoke, inhaling loudly, and looked around wildly for the creature from my dream. Instead, I felt a cool hand on my shoulder and wheeled around, fists swinging, to see Ignatius in the driver’s seat with a look of concern on his face.\\n\\n“You okay? Don’t move so much, you’re still hurt.”\\n\\nIgnatius placed both hands on my shoulders as I continued to shiver, eyes darting all over the place to make sure the creature wasn’t present, “Dorothy? You were dreaming, okay? You’re safe now.”\\n\\nI clung to his forearm, I had to make sure he was real. Ignatius allowed this as I collected my thoughts. After calming down some, I looked around again, “We’re here? How long was I out?”\\n\\nIgnatius removed his hands and sat back in his seat again with an odd look on his face.\\n\\n“Actually we’re just up the road from the clinic. You started thrashing around a little there so I thought I should stop and wake you. Must have been a pretty bad dream?”\\n\\nHe got the car going again and we sped down the street towards the clinic.\\n\\n“Yeah, something like that,” I mumbled, then grimaced as all the pain of my body came rushing back to me at once. Ignatius took my hand and gave it a little squeeze, keeping one steady hand on the wheel.\\n\\n“We’re almost there. This should be a quick fix. And, on top of that, your own healing abilities should be activated by now anyway.”\\n\\nHe had a point. Every wolf-shifter gains enhanced healing abilities around their teenage years, it was the reason no one ever saw the bruises and grazes dealt to me over time - courtesy of Mavis’s posse and Lana’s particularly potent left hook.\\n\\nWhy then was it not working now? The gash in my forehead should have been sealing itself up already but upon close inspection in the rearview mirror, it still remained open and raw.\\n\\nIgnatius seemed to notice as well. He leaned closer, examining my forehead as we drove.\\n\\n“Well. That’s not good.”\\n\\n“What do you mean it’s not good?” My voice betrayed the alarm I was feeling, “What’s wrong with me?”\\n\\nIgnatius shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea, but we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nI looked forward and noticed we’d arrived at the clinic. Because wolf-shifters have different healing abilities compared to the average human, each pack has its own clinic with skilled healers to deal with whatever ailments our bodies can’t fix on their own.\\n\\nAilments like an apparently faulty healing ability. I closed my eyes. Today hadn’t turned out at all like I had expected it to. I should have just stayed in bed.\\n\\nIgnatius refused to let me attempt walking by myself. He carried me through the revolving doors and spoke with the receptionist while I sat mute in his arms, scowling at the wall behind us. If he hadn’t been so helpful today I would have berated him for babying me in that moment.\\n\\nA nurse led us to an empty bed and hurried away again to fetch a healer.\\n\\n“You don’t have to stay,” I said, as Ignatius placed me gently on the crisp sheets and settled into a chair next to me, “Thank you for everything you’ve done but I think I can handle things from here.”\\n\\n“I have time to spare,” Ignatius clasped his hands together and leaned his forearms on his knees, “And thinking about it now, we haven’t even been properly acquainted. You’re a friend of Johan’s?”\\n\\nI shook my head, a part of me was relieved to have company. And something about this boy was incredibly compelling to me.\\n\\n“No. Well, not exactly. How do you know Johan?”\\n\\nUttering his name had my stomach twisting painfully and my inner-wolf shied from the melancholy.\\n\\nBefore Ignatius could answer me, the healer stepped in - a short wrinkled woman with tanned skin and dozens of red beads braided into her hair. She adjusted her glasses and frowned when she saw Ignatius in the chair.\\n\\n“You’re not from here boy. You smell of the sea to the North. Don’t tell me you’re responsible for her injuries?”\\n\\n“He’s not,” I interrupted before Ignatius could answer, “He’s been helping me. He’s a - a friend.”\\n\\nI didn’t really know what Ignatius was to me but the fact that he was sticking around meant a lot, although I would never admit it to myself.\\n\\nThe healer narrowed her eyes at Ignatious who raised both his hands in a mock surrender.\\n\\n“Very well. Let’s take a look at you then.”\\n\\nShe tilted my head back to examine the gash, frowning as she did so. “Odd, this should be healing up already. And I’m told your ribs are hurt too…”\\n\\nI sat quietly while she poked and prodded and tutted around me, raising my eyebrow at Ignatius who mouthed back; “Weird old bat.”\\n\\nI stifled a giggle which in turn had me wincing at the pain it caused me.\\n\\n“You.”\\n\\nThe healer pointed a bony finger at Ignatius without turning around.\\n\\n“I will not hesitate to kick you out of here.”\\n\\nIgnatius leaned back in his chair with a smirk.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of inspecting me and berating Ignatius, the healer came to the conclusion that two of my ribs were fractured and I had suffered a mild concussion.\\n\\n“As for your lack of healing abilities,” she glanced over at Ignatious and back to me, “I can think of a few reasons why that could be. We need to have a talk in private.”\\n\\nShe shooed Ignatius out while he promised me he would be waiting right outside. After she finally got him to leave and shut the door in his face, she turned to me, her eyes were serious and her mouth pressed into a thin line.\\n\\n“Dorothy.”\\n\\nShe came to stand before me.\\n\\n“Have you found your mate yet?”\\n\\nHer question caught me by surprise, there was no way she could have known about today. I stammered out a feeble lie in response, asking what she meant by that. She shook her head.\\n\\n“Don’t lie to me. This is about your healing powers. Did you know your powers could be weakened by a rejection from your true mate?”\\n\\n“He hasn’t rejected me!” I protested, louder than I had intended to.\\n\\n“He hasn’t. Not yet…”\\n\\nThe lump in my throat returned and I was on the brink of tears once again. The healer’s eyes softened slightly and she sat down next to me on the bed.\\n\\n“There’s your problem dear. To go on with or without your mate, if the bond between the two of you is not broken or sealed completely, your abilities will never come back.”\\n\\nI sniffed back a sob, rubbing my eyes, “What are you saying?”\\n\\nShe handed me a tissue and waited a moment while I blew into it - angry at myself for being so fragile.\\n\\n“This mate, whoever he is, you have to break the bond officially. If you don’t, things are only going to get worse for the both of you.”\\n\\nI dropped my head into my hands. Whatever “worse” meant I doubted it could top what I was already feeling.\\n\\n“Your stunted healing is only the beginning,” she continued, gently patting my back. “You have to put an end to this now before you go into heat.”\\n\\nHeat? I didn’t bother asking, too caught up in my own sadness to care about what it meant for my future.\\n\\nAfter patching up my forehead somewhat, the healer left me on my own for a while to cry. She told me they had something to help with the pain, but it would only be a temporary fix. I lay curled up on the bed and let the tears fall.\\n\\nI had to break the bond between Johan and me. I had no choice, asking him not to reject me yet was only temporarily avoiding the inevitable. He didn’t want me. There was no avoiding the bitter truth.\\n\\nI heard someone enter the room and peeked out from under my arm. I was expecting the healer but it was Ignatius kneeling at my bedside.\\n\\n“Christ. What did the old bat say to make you cry like this.”\\n\\nHis eyes were sympathetic but I was appalled to be seen in this state. I buried my face in the pillow and gulped back the tears.\\n\\nIgnatius wasn’t having it though and touched my arm gently.\\n\\n“Hey, Dorothy. What did she say?”\\n\\nI couldn’t tell him. Couldn’t find the words to explain the pain that I was feeling.\\n\\nIgnatius hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Does any of this have something to do with Johan? I know it was his girlfriend’s group who attacked you.”\\n\\nI lifted my arm to look at him again. It felt like his blue eyes were boring into my soul. The ceiling fan above us creaked softly as it spun lazily on its axel. I rolled onto my back and stared up at it.\\n\\n“Johan is my mate.”\\n\\nIgnatius was silent for a moment. I kept my eyes on the slowly spinning fan. The rusted wings were caked with dust from years of propelling air laced with debris from the forest outside.\\n\\nWhen he finally spoke, he was perplexed.\\n\\n“Johan… is your mate? Well, I guess that explains his aggression when I put you in my car but why were things so stiff between you two? Does he know you’re his mate?”\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut, balling my hands into fists as I relived the moment.\\n\\n“Then why were you attacked,” Ignatius continued, “and… What about Mavis? Did he end things with her?”\\n\\nI turned my face to look at him and it seemed that my somber expression was enough to put a stop to his questioning. I felt a tear roll from my eye and wrestled to keep my voice steady. It was no use though, It came out like a quiet sigh of defeat.\\n\\n“He didn’t end things with Mavis. And he’s not going to. Because he doesn’t want me as his mate. He made that very clear.”\\n\\nIgnatius’s concerned expression was frozen on his face as I continued, “Mavis’s friends attacked me because they saw us together. They knew I was his mate and that Mavis wouldn’t be happy about it.”\\n\\nI touched the gauze on my forehead.\\n\\n“I asked him not to reject me today. But if we don’t break the bond completely, my abilities will never come back. In fact, things are only going to get worse.”\\n\\nI quoted the healer’s words, my tone flat and lifeless.\\n\\nIgnatius was quiet beside me, his face inches from mine where he knelt by the bed. I gave him a small, empty smile and turned my gaze back up to the fan on the ceiling. It spun around and around above me, creaking softly in the otherwise silent room.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 5\\n~Ignatius~\\n\\nMy brief visit to Johan’s neighborhood hadn’t ended up very brief at all. I had only meant to stop by the college for a few minutes to catch up with my old friend.\\n\\nHowever, the moment I noticed the small crew of girls heading towards a solitary figure on the outskirts of the college campus, I knew something bad was about to go down.\\n\\nSpotting Claudia, Mavis’s top watchdog, amongst them only confirmed my suspicions. Claudia was ruthless and whoever she was after now was not in for a good time.\\n\\nI had already started towards the group when they began their beatdown. Breaking into a run, I could just make out a small figure curled on the ground and a shock of fiery red hair. Dorothy, I would come to learn, was her name.\\n\\nCarrying her in my arms, I found myself enveloped in her scent. The smell of fresh air and gentle rain - floral and enticing. I wasn’t sure why Claudia and her gang had chosen this particular slip of a girl as their newest victim but I was enraged at their brutality all the same.\\n\\nIf I hadn’t had Dorothy in my arms I would have tracked them down and broken more than just a few of their manicured nails. Then again, considering the fragile allyship between their pack and ours, It wouldn’t look very good for the son of the Northern pack leader to launch an attack on a few Southerner girls.\\n\\nGaging from Dorothy’s nonchalant reaction to the ordeal, it was clear that she bore the brunt of their bullying quite often. Often enough to get used to it. And then there was Johan, I had never seen him act so strange as he had, standing there in the parking lot.\\n\\nWe had been fast friends for years. But around this girl, he had been on edge and angry - prepared to fight. We had fought often as children, even as young teens. But this Johan was different, territorial, and on edge.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after that when I learned why. Dorothy was his true mate. Thinking about it afterward, his possessive, primal attitude should have been a clear sign of that fact. He clearly wanted her. And his inner-wolf must have been seething at another man handling his mate. An Alpha at that.\\n\\nI had felt a pang of guilt at my own actions after Dorothy revealed the truth to me. I hadn’t intended to upset my friend or take what his inner-wolf demanded was his.\\n\\nBut with that being said, Dorothy was hurt and in need of assistance, and - in that volatile state - Johan would have been no help in the situation at best and a danger to Dorothy at worst.\\n\\nFurthermore, I was astonished at his rejection of Dorothy, albeit not an official one. I had met Mavis on multiple occasions and while I could admit she was pretty, the venom in her eyes was clear as day to me.\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom rejecting one’s true mate for a woman so potently cruel. My heart ached for Dorothy. I had only known her for a few hours at most but I had been rocked by the urge to protect her from the moment I laid eyes on her brilliant red hair and caught her faint scent on the breeze.\\n\\nTo lose a mate was an indescribable pain. I had felt it myself once. Unlike Dorothy, I hadn’t been rejected, but a stormy night and a fatal car accident had snatched them away from me. There is no pain quite like that of losing what you love the most.\\n\\nThe memory of that affliction was locked away in the furthermost corners of my mind - only to be carefully opened and examined over and over again in the quiet confines of my own bedroom in the dead of night.\\n\\nWhile I couldn’t entirely understand Dorothy’s pain, I could empathize. Watching her tears fall freely as she lay on the bed in that clinic, I fought the overwhelming urge to take her in my arms again.\\n\\nIt hurt to see her so clearly suffering. I wanted nothing more than to fix what was broken and witness a smile - a real smile - as I was sure it would be a beautiful one. Dorothy, however, was not mine to embrace. I was little more than a stranger to her.\\n\\nAll the same, it was difficult to keep my distance and I reached for her small, slender hand. Dorothy refused to look at me for a moment, keeping her eyes trained to the fan on the ceiling and denying my sympathies with a tight-lipped frown. Her fingers, however, closed around mine and she gripped my hand tightly.\\n\\nWe stayed like that for a good long while, comforted by quiet company, before the healer returned with a handful of what looked like powdery sticks and a vile of inky black liquid. Dorothy tried to get up and I propped a hand on her back, easing her into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe gave me a small smile in response and blinked away the tears that had been building on her long, light lashes.\\n\\n“Now then,” the old bat huffed.\\n\\n“Take this three times a day.”\\n\\nShe held the vile to Dorothy’s face.\\n\\nDorothy grimaced at the black liquid sloshing inside the glass, “No more than one teaspoon, or you’ll knock yourself out for hours. And this-” She held up the powdery sticks and snapped them in half under Dorothy’s nose.\\n\\nA shimmer of gray and brown powder burst from the sticks and Dorothy choked and spluttered as she inhaled it, “What - what was that!” she gasped hoarsely, bringing a hand to her chest.\\n\\n“Sugersnap Thyme. Helps with pain.”\\n\\nThe healer waved the sticks around a little more before tucking them away again, “It might make you a little drowsy and disorientated so I suggest you have your young, seaweed-smelling friend take you home.”\\n\\nShe looked pointedly at me over her glasses and I nodded in response, “Yes, Ma’am.”\\n\\n“Uh-Uh,” Dorothy piped up in protest, “not home. I don’t wanna go home.”\\n\\nHer words slurred a little at the end as the old bat’s magic sticks seemed to be taking effect. She lolled forwards and I rushed to catch her, scooping her up and holding her against my chest.\\n\\n“Don’t wanna go home,” she mumbled into my neck and I could hear the stubborn pout in her voice as she said it.\\n\\n“That’s okay, you can stay at my place for a little if you want.”\\n\\nI could see the old bat eyeing me suspiciously, “I’m staying at a villa for the weekend. Right up the road,” I continued as she narrowed her eyes at me. She thought it over for a moment.\\n\\n“Fine,” she eventually relented, handing me the bottle of putrid-looking medicine. “But be sure to let her parents know. Their number should be in the books at the front desk. Everyone in the pack is.”\\n\\nI took the bottle and thanked her for all of her help.\\n\\n“And you be good to that girl,” she continued, “I’ll be checking in later,” I promised to be on my best behavior. Dorothy grumbled out a half-assed thank you and something about a monster in the forest.\\n\\nAfter finding her name scribbled next to multiple home addresses and five different numbers in the big book at the front desk, I carried a very disorientated Dorothy to my car and somehow managed to get her into the passenger seat without bumping her rolling head on the way in.\\n\\nClimbing into the driver’s seat, I heard her say something about a creature in the dark.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nI leaned over to hear her better, buckling her seatbelt at the same time - she wouldn’t feel her ribs aching right now and I didn’t trust her to not topple off the seat entirely on the drive. Instead of answering, she scoffed at me and leaned her head against the window with drooping lids.\\n\\n“Alrighty then.”\\n\\nI spent the drive home calling all five numbers I’d saved on my phone, one at a time. The first three didn’t answer but on the second to last number a gruff-sounding woman told me to try the last number, explaining that she had been Dorothy’s foster mom for a while.\\n\\nShe also mysteriously griped about a pet frog and an expensive cheese platter before hanging up. The final number rang for half a second before someone picked up and I heard a frantic woman’s voice crackle through the phone, “Dorothy?”\\n\\n“Not quite. This is Ignatius Aamodt. Dorothy’s okay, she’s just had a bit of a rough day.”\\n\\n“Ignatius… Elliot’s son?”\\n\\nIt seemed the Southern Pack was well informed about their new allies.\\n\\n“That’s the one. Are you Dorothy’s foster mother?”\\n\\n“Anita, yes. Where is Dorothy? She was supposed to be back by now. Are you her mate -”\\n\\nShe stopped herself, possibly concerned that she’d said too much.\\n\\n“No, I’m not. It would seem… Things didn’t really go to plan for Dorothy.”\\n\\n“Oh. I had hoped… Nevermind. Where is she now?” There was genuine morosity in her voice.\\n\\nShe seemed to truly care for Dorothy and I found myself wondering if Dorothy herself was aware of that. I looked over at Dorothy, who was currently snoozing in her seat. She swatted the air with one feeble hand and then settled back into her dozing.\\n\\n“Currently snoring in my car. We’re heading to the Blue Villa Hotel on Fort Grayvill, I’ll let Dorothy know to call you when she wakes up.”\\n\\nAfter exchanging addresses with Anita and promising to be in contact I hung up and glanced over at Dorothy again. She looked so tiny and fragile curled up there on the seat. Her hair was making a solid attempt to escape the braid it was caught in, cascading down her shoulder and sticking out in little curling wisps of red and gold.\\n\\nHer skin had a pale, almost translucent glow to it and she had the tiniest smattering of freckles over her nose. The tiny opal knotted on a thin string around her neck was the color of her eyes. Eyes that were now scrunched closed like she was fighting monsters in her dreams.\\n\\nMy thoughts wandered back to the nightmare I’d woken her from earlier. The creature in the woods she’d said, or something to that extent. Something about this girl had sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to know more about her.\\n\\nTo get to know her. I wanted to know if she preferred strawberries or orange slices, winter or spring. I wanted to get to know Dorothy, although I wasn’t entirely sure why.\\n\\nI found myself so deep in my musings I almost missed the turnoff to the villa I’d rented out for the duration of my stay. I could have stayed with my father in the fancier hotel further on. But the thought of waking up to Elliot’s cold demeanor every morning was daunting and I was weak in that regard.\\n\\nI pulled the car into the parking area and tried to wake Dorothy up. Her eyelids fluttered and I caught a glimpse of those striking opal irises before she was out once more. Getting out and rounding the car, I unbuckled her and lifted her to my chest again.\\n\\nDorothy wrapped both arms around my neck and sighed into my ear, still half asleep and much less indignant about me carrying her than she would have been if she was awake. Her breath on my neck sent shivers down my spine and her scent was stronger than ever.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun was sending slanted rays of light through the trees nearby and made her hair look even brighter, radiating in the golden glow. Turning to head into the villa I noticed another car parked in the empty bay beside mine. A familiar car. My gaze shot to the entrance of the villa where Johan was leaning against the door with folded arms.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha ”🤩🤩', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔥Read the full version👉Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'KeenNovels', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101464925740704', 'page_likes': 28, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101464925740704', 'ads_count': 14, 'cumulative_ads_count': 14, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:09:41', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Bats and jackals, bears and cats. Vampires, so unnatural in their beauty and strength. But none are more powerful than the wolf shifters. With both instinct and human intelligence, so intertwined with nature and humankind itself, we are more of this earth than you are.\\n\\nI don’t remember much of my mother or pack, but I remember her stories of our kinds’ abilities and the enemies that plague us. Not wholly evil, and not entirely good, those tales haunted my nightmares and dreams alike for years after I was too old for bedtime stories and forgot my mother’s face entirely.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 1\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI awoke that morning with a twisting knot of anxiety in my stomach. I rolled onto my side under the covers and clung to my pillow tightly before heaving in a deep breath and getting up. Today was my eighteenth birthday. Today, I would find my mate.\\n\\nStanding up I examined myself in the mirror, frowning at the spindly pale girl gazing back at me. I wondered if a mate would reject their match based on looks alone. I pulled my hair up into a ponytail before exhaling through my nose and letting it fall loose around my shoulders again.\\n\\nThe bright red locks only made me look paler. I could sense my mate, it seemed they were nearby.\\n\\nIf they didn’t come looking for me there was a good chance I would find them first - their scent almost palatable on my tongue. Already my inner-wolf seemed to crave them, rearing to seek them out. Whoever it was.\\n\\nI could sense something odd about my new mate. While all the desire and enthrallment were present on my side, something about their energy felt off. Things were off to a great start, I thought, tensely pulling at a strand of hair.\\n\\nDespite my nervousness, I couldn’t help the excitement bubbling up inside my chest. I had waited for this day since I had been old enough to understand the mating call. I had wanted this day since I was old enough to want for anything. To be wanted…\\n\\nI was snapped out of my pondering by a quiet knock on my bedroom door. Anita, my current caretaker poked her head in and gave me a small smile.\\n\\n“Today’s the day,” Anita didn’t step into the room - the relationship too short and unfamiliar for affections of any kind, “Are you excited?”\\n\\nI turned back to the mirror and glowered at my reflection.\\n\\n“More like sick to my stomach. What if they don’t like me?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” Anita tutted, brushing the air, “Whoever it is, they’re your mate. And besides, you’re a beautiful girl on top of all that spunk of yours.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile a little. Passed around from foster home to foster home, I had only known Anita for a little over a month at that point, but her kind words eased my quivering nerves slightly.\\n\\nAnita promised to whip up an extra special breakfast - “waffles and hashbrowns!” - before leaving me to get ready for college.\\n\\nAlone and overwhelmed again, I was torn between putting on my best outfits and attempting some kind of make-up endeavor, or treating today like any other day and donning my regular jeans and turtleneck.\\n\\nIn the end, I went for my standard attire with some added rings and necklaces to convey some sort of actual effort.\\n\\nLastly, I swept my fiery hair into a rough braid and pinned the loose wisps back with a collection of different colored clips. After forcing down a bite or two of steaming waffle I assured Anita I would have the rest when I returned and headed out to campus.\\n\\nThe local college was a ten-minute walk from my current home and I spent the entire trip going over introductions in my head.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I’m your mate.”\\n\\nSounded way too formal.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it to campus, I was a quaking bundle of nerves. I wasn’t even entirely sure that my mate went to this college. Although considering it was the only college attended by every young wolf-shifter of the nearby packs, it was highly likely.\\n\\nOn top of that, my inner-wolf grew even more agitated the second I stepped inside. My mate was close, I could smell the hint of pine and englewood in their scent.\\n\\nBefore I had half a chance to look, it was time to head to class. I spent the first hour relentlessly gnawing on the end of my pen and meticulously fiddling with my braid until the whole thing looked like a frazzled mess. All the while running through various introductions to no avail.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I think I’m your mate?”\\n\\nToo timid. I groaned loud enough to startle the dozing boy sitting next to me and plopped my head down onto the desk in defeat.\\n\\nAfter two more hours of barely containing my growing excitement, I was finally free to stalk the campus, following the comforting scent of my soon-to-be mate.\\n\\nI kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the other students who jostled around me in the corridors. I wasn’t particularly popular at this school and people passed me by like I was invisible.\\n\\nThe scent was stronger now, I knew my mate was close. Turning a corner I shivered in anticipation. My legs felt like jelly and my small bites of breakfast were threatening to crawl back up my throat. Then, suddenly, there he was. I knew he was my mate the second I lay eyes on him.\\n\\nHe was leaning against the wall in front of me, flipping through a stack of notes like he didn’t know what else to do with himself. Johan, a gentle Beta of the Kall Pack - it was very likely that he didn’t know of me at all. But I knew him. I was also uncomfortably aware that his girlfriend was the prettiest she-wolf in their pack.\\n\\nI was stunned. I stood there for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the boy in front of me. He hadn’t noticed me yet - but surely he could sense me?\\n\\nJohan ran a hand through his hair - short wavy locks the color of wheat - and continued flipping through pages with a furrowed brow. My courage failing me, I took a small step back.\\n\\nMy inner-wolf raged in response but my mind was suddenly flooded with doubt. Why couldn’t he sense my presence? Maybe he could, but didn’t want to acknowledge me. Surely he would leave his girlfriend now that it was clear that I was his true mate? I took another step back into the shadows of the hallway, preparing to leave.\\n\\nSuddenly, Johan raised his head and looked straight at me. Gentle brown eyes locked with mine and he gave a half-smile that accentuated the dimple in his cheek. Overwhelmed and caught off guard, I turned tail and sprinted back down the way I’d come.\\n\\nIt was all too much. I couldn’t think straight. A million thoughts shot through my mind as I ran, my sneakers squeaking on the laminated floors.\\n\\nJohan was perfect. He was soft and kind and absolutely gorgeous. But he wasn’t mine. Fighting back tears as I made my way to the bathrooms, rushing into a cubicle and slamming the door shut behind me.\\n\\nI pressed my forehead to the cool concrete of the stall and tried to organize my thoughts. Johan was my mate - Johan knew that I was his. He had to. But Johan also had a girlfriend - Mavis - someone who was miles ahead of me in terms of looks, status, and charisma. Mavis who, along with her posse of beautiful airheads, had bullied me since I had joined their pack as a kid.\\n\\nI slid to the floor and put my head on my knees. I thought I would be ready for this day. Today was supposed to be perfect. Today I was supposed to finally belong somewhere.\\n\\nA few treacherous tears escaped and slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away roughly and sniffed. A sudden knock on the cubicle door had me jumping in my skin.\\n\\n“Um, Dorothy?”\\n\\nA quiet voice from the other side, a voice like milk and honey, “Hey, um, Dorothy could you come out here? I promise I won’t bite.”\\n\\nI could hear the grin in Johan’s voice at that last part. His scent, so close and comforting, enveloped me. Hesitantly, I got to my feet, wiping my teary eyes on my sleeve, and opened the door slightly. I peaked out at the boy standing at the door, and he chuckled at my dramatic pouting.\\n\\n“Geez, you run away and frown at me before we’ve even been properly introduced?”\\n\\nHis words were chiding but his tone was light and there was a humorous glimmer in his eye. I swung the door fully open and came to stand in front of him. I stared down at my shoes, hoping he wouldn’t notice my reddened eyes.\\n\\n“I just… didn’t know what to say.”\\n\\nI still didn’t, really. Standing before this beautiful boy, my true mate, all of my confidence went out the window along with my ability to form sentences.\\n\\n“Well, we can start slow,” Johan offered me his hand, “Would you mind if we talk somewhere else? As much as I’d love to hang around the girl’s bathroom I don’t think the ladies will be particularly happy with my being here.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took Johan’s hand and let him guide me out of the bathroom and through the throngs of students towards the small indoor garden.\\n\\nHe sat down on the creaking wooden bench and gestured for me to join him. I plonked down next to him and immediately berated myself mentally for not even trying to be graceful. Johan didn’t seem to mind though and he leaned back on the bench, folding his arms and cocking his chin to gaze at me.\\n\\n“So… my name is Johan-”\\n\\nI couldn’t help a short laugh, cutting him off, and waved my hand to dismiss his introduction.\\n\\n“I know who you are. Everyone here knows who you are. You’re the pack’s golden boy with the bombshell girlfriend and a father on the council. I would have been living under a rock all this time if I didn’t know your name.”\\n\\nJohan smirked and raised an eyebrow at me. “Okay, my reputation precedes me, it would seem.”\\n\\nI breathed a quiet sigh of relief that my interruption didn’t seem to offend him.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Johan continued, “You’re Dorothy right? I’ve seen you around campus a few times,” He laughed at my incredulous expression, “Your hair is a little hard to miss.”\\n\\nI blushed brighter than my locks at that comment and twisted my braid between my fingers. We spoke for a while, I explained that I had been moving between foster homes since I’d been left with the pack as a small child.\\n\\nJohan told me about his father’s strict parenting that landed him with his “golden boy” persona in the first place.\\n\\nAs we talked, I felt myself begin to relax, comfortable in Johan’s calm presence. The excitement I had felt earlier that morning was back and I couldn’t help but smile openly while speaking with my true mate.\\n\\nJohan spoke with a laid-back, boyish attitude and waved his hands around while describing how he and an old friend had once been chased around the woods by a jackal they’d mistaken for a wolf-shifter when they were children.\\n\\nI in turn gave him a dramatic retelling of the story about a pet frog I’d once had and how it had gotten into one of my caretaker’s handbags on their big, fancy date night.\\n\\nAfter a while, Johan’s tone grew more serious and he took my hand in his. I felt prickles of electricity where his skin touched mine and I looked into his chocolate brown eyes in earnest. This was it. He was going to accept me as his mate.\\n\\nI could barely contain my excitement and I could feel my inner-wolf singing in my chest. Johan’s expression, however, was puzzling - almost sympathetic.\\n\\n“Dorothy, you’re beautiful. You’re ‘perfect’. I can feel the connection we have and I know now that you are my true mate. You always have been. But…” he hesitated - wincing like the words hurt to force out, “But I already love someone else - Mavis, her and I… we promised we’d stay together.”\\n\\nIt felt as if a carpet had been pulled from beneath my feet but instead of the ground, there was only open space. I pulled my hand away from Johan even though it pained me to do it.\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\nMy voice cracked slightly, and my eyes pricked with tears once more.\\n\\nJohan’s face contorted as he fought to keep his voice steady, “Dorothy...”\\n\\nI leaned away from him, shaking my head and covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to hear it. I couldn’t. Johan took my face in his hands, using a thumb to wipe a tear that was trailing down my cheek.\\n\\n“Dorothy, I can’t accept you as my mate. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nJohan held onto me as I burst into tears, burying my face in his chest and soaking in his scent while I still could.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 2\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nIt was a long while before my wailing petered out into quiet sobs. I leaned into Johan who had his arms around me, stroking my hair and cradling my shaking frame. I inhaled against his neck and clutched the fabric of his shirt with trembling hands.\\n\\n“Please, don’t reject me yet. Not today.”\\n\\nMy voice was hoarse, a little more than a whisper as I clung to him, “Let me at least have today, even if it’s fake.”\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom a rejection so monumental. Not here, alone on campus where everyone could witness the aftermath. And not today - it was too much to bear.\\n\\nJohan was silent for a moment, rocking me gently as he thought it over.\\n\\n“Alright. Not today.”\\n\\nHe squeezed my shoulders tightly before releasing me and standing up, “I should get going. Again, I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nHe reached out as if to touch my hair, but drew his hand away abruptly, shoving it into his pocket instead. Turning with jerky movements, Johan left the garden and disappeared into the bustling corridor without another word.\\n\\nI stared after him, motionless and empty. My inner-wolf cried in anguish deep inside of my chest. I felt numb, my tears used up, and what little hope I had left was shattered entirely.\\n\\nA part of me wanted to scream and cry for Johan to come back. To beg him to stay. But I was exhausted, and the small voice in the back of my mind was whispering that I shouldn’t have expected anything else. That I would never be wanted. That I would never belong.\\n\\nHeaving myself off the bench, I left the garden on legs that felt like lead. The thought of more classes after what had just happened was unbearable. I slipped out of the college instead and headed towards the woods just outside of campus. Going home wasn’t an option either.\\n\\nAlthough Anita would be understanding, her sympathetic smile would only make me feel worse. In that moment, I just wanted to be alone. I scuffed my sneaker on the tarmac and inhaled the fresh scent of the woods before me. Pine and Engelwood, just like him. I pushed the thought from my mind.\\n\\nBefore I could make it to the woods, however, I heard multiple sets of footsteps catching up behind me and turned to see five of Mavis’s crew heading my way. Why now?\\n\\nI contemplated running, but among the group, I’d spotted Lana, who, with her long slender limbs and athletic abilities had always managed to run me down before.\\n\\nI didn’t see this time going any differently. Instead, I slowed my pace and let them catch up with me, forming a half-circle between their prey and the forest. I folded my arms and prepared to defend myself.\\n\\n“Hello, gingersnap, what has you running out here with your tail between your legs?” Claudia, the speaker in question, donned a malicious fake smile while she blinked at me.\\n\\n“Well hello Claudia, why don’t you mind your own business for once?” I sneered back, “Doesn’t Mavis need her guard dogs today?”\\n\\nI hoped they couldn’t hear the tremble in my voice. Hoped they wouldn’t notice my puffy eyes and tear-streaked face.\\n\\nHatred flashed in Claudia’s eyes and she prodded my chest with one perfectly manicured nail, “I heard somebody found her mate today,” she said in a sing-song voice and poked me again, harder this time.\\n\\nI smacked her hand away. “That’s got nothing to do with any of you.”\\n\\nCladia retracted her clawed hand and coked her head to the side. “Oh, but it does. I heard you were getting quite cozy with Johan over in the gardens earlier. And Alissa said she even saw the two of you leave the bathroom together. Didn’t you Alissa?”\\n\\nShe looked over at the bottle blonde to her left who shrugged and nodded vaguely like the entire conversation disinterested her.\\n\\n“It’s not what you think, he doesn’t even want -” My words came out jumbled and I cut myself off, unable to voice the painful truth.\\n\\nClaudia made no effort to conceal the joy this torment brought her. A cold grin settled across her face. “He doesn’t want you.”\\n\\nWith that, I decided I had had enough. I pushed past the tall girl and made for the canopy of the forest. Claudia clearly wasn’t letting me go that easily though and she gripped my shirt at the shoulder, yanking me backward and sending me to the ground before I could steady myself.\\n\\nClaudia was strong. Inhumanly strong. She was using the strength of her inner-wolf and she was all the more dangerous for it.\\n\\nI landed on my back and immediately tried to scramble to my feet only for Claudia to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach with her pointed boot. I buckled, winded, and collapsed to my knees. I had no time to gasp for air before Lana delivered another kick to my side, and sent me sprawling on the tarmac again.\\n\\nClaudia reached down, grabbing my hair, and yanked my head up to face the girls. “We couldn’t care less about you or who you decide to pine over. But you got a little too close to Mavis’s man and we can’t allow that.”\\n\\nWith that, she slammed my head against the ground causing stars to explode across my vision and blood to pour from both my nose and a nasty new gash in my brow. The girls continued their assault, taunting and jeering while I curled up on my side in an attempt to protect myself.\\n\\nI could barely think straight, my mind was foggy and I cried out at every jab and kick that hit its mark. It felt like they were aiming to kill. I had endured their torment time and time again but this time they weren’t holding back.\\n\\nThe attack went on for what felt like forever when suddenly, through the fog I heard a new voice speak up.\\n\\n“What the fuck is going on here?”\\n\\nA voice so low and dangerous. A voice like ice.\\n\\nThe girls halted their attack and a new scent washed over me - overpowering and intoxicating, it was a musky rose with the echo of a sea breeze. I couldn’t see this new stranger from my fetal position on the ground but I could sense him with every fiber of my being.\\n\\nThe hair on my neck rose and my heart slowed into deep rhythmic beats that reverberated through my entire body.\\n\\n“Who are you supposed to b-” I heard Lana start before she was abruptly cut off by Claudia.\\n\\n“Let’s go. Now.”\\n\\nThere was genuine fear in her voice.\\n\\nI could hear them hurry away, and unfolded myself to catch a glimpse of the stranger who’d saved me. The blood from the wound to my head had dripped down into my eyes and made it difficult to see. I squinted in the direction of the dominating scent and feebly rubbed at my eyes.\\n\\nStanding over me was a boy whose appearance matched the tone of his voice. Cold, and unsettling. His hair was snow white and ruffled like it was caught in a perpetual gust of wind. Dark brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes that were gazing down intently at me.\\n\\n“Who - argh!” I tried to get to my feet but a sharp fiery pain in my side kept me down.\\n\\n“Try not to move too much.” The stranger knelt down and slid a hand between my head and the rough ground, “Looks like they did a number on your ribs.”\\n\\nI winced as he tilted my head slightly to examine the bleeding cut, “Didn’t go easy on your face either,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nI groaned as another sharp pain shot through my side. The bleeding from my nose had slowed but there was no doubt that I looked like a god-awful mess.\\n\\n“Someone should see to that. Do you think you can stand?”\\n\\nThe stranger frowned as I tried to get to my knees and failed miserably, clutching my side and moaning in frustration.\\n\\n“Guess not. Why did those girls have it out for you anyway?” he asked while slinging my arm over his shoulder and lifting me to my feet. He went a step further and swung an arm under my knees, lifting me off the ground and cradling me in his arms.\\n\\nHe took care to be gentle around my aching ribs and headed back towards the college campus. Too tired and injured to be embarrassed, I rested my head against his chest - a chest like warm marble.\\n\\n“They’ve never really needed a reason to do what they do.”\\n\\nI didn’t feel like explaining the truth. I had had enough humiliation for one day without explaining my mate’s rejection to an odd stranger. The answer seemed satisfying enough to him though as he shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n“Typical. Anyway, we need to get you to a doctor. Make sure nothing is broken.”\\n\\n“Hmm.”\\n\\nI was only half-listening, fatigue catching up with me after the events of the day. On top of that, I found I was quite enjoying this boy’s strange scent.\\n\\nAnother wave of pain snapped me out of my trance and I swiveled my head to gaze up at the guy’s face. From this angle, his jawline looked like the edge of a cliff. Everything about him seemed sharp enough to cut.\\n\\n“Who exactly are you?” I asked tentatively. I’d never seen him around before. I was sure I would have remembered a face like that.\\n\\n“Ignatius. I’m from the Allied Pack further North but my father is down here for an Elders meeting. Thought I’d tag along and visit some old friends.”\\n\\nHe glanced down, raising one dark eyebrow at me, “And who are you, little Miss five-on-one?”\\n\\nHis gaze had my stomach twisting in knots and my inner-wolf was stirring in response to this new anomaly. I forced my suddenly gaping mouth closed and looked away.\\n\\n“I’m nobody special.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange name.”\\n\\nHis tone was somehow flat and slightly amused simultaneously. I glowered at his small smirk, wiping my nose where fresh blood was drizzling out.\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy. I’m a part of this area’s pack but not really. And this morning I had waffles and syrup for breakfast.”\\n\\nI turned my nose up and faced away from him again, determined to not share any more of my incredibly mundane current life.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of silent walking and being carried around like a sack of delicate potatoes, I asked, “Do you, like, have a car, or do you plan to walk us to the hospital?”\\n\\nWithout answering, Ignatious rounded the corner with me and fished a set of car keys out of his pocket. Striding up to a flashy, old-school Impala, he unlocked the passenger door and stooped to put me down.\\n\\nBefore he could manage that, however, we were interrupted. A comforting scent, the slightest hint of pine in the air.\\n\\n“Dorothy?”\\n\\nIgnatius turned with me in his arms to face Johan, standing a few feet away.\\n\\n“Dorothy, what happened to you?”\\n\\nGenuine concern in his voice, he seemed as gentle as ever but there was tension in his shoulders and his lips twitched slightly as he eyed Ignatius and his pale arms firmly handling me.\\n\\n“Johan,” Ignatius said nonchalantly, while my head snapped up to look at him so fast I damn near gave myself whiplash, “Long time no see, old friend.”\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 3\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\n“You know each other?” I squeaked, clinging tighter to Ignatius now that Johan’s scent was present and toying with my emotions once again.\\n\\nNeither responded to my question but instead, Johan stepped closer, reaching for me, stiltedly like he couldn’t control his movements. My internal heartbreak still fresh, I cowered away from him into Ignatious’s chest.\\n\\n“I’m okay. Really it’s fine.”\\n\\nI was fighting to keep my tone even but my voice shook slightly.\\n\\n“Um, Ignatious is just helping me out.”\\n\\nIgnatius himself seemed confused by the odd interaction between Johan and me, but thankfully he caught on to the fact that the situation was more than uncomfortable. He proceeded to place me gently in the passenger seat and straightened up to face Johan again.\\n\\n“She was attacked by some students. Gonna take her down to the healer to fix her up.”\\n\\nIgnatius tried to close the passenger door behind him but Johan put a hand out to stop him. He seemed to be wrestling with himself internally, his shoulders shaking and his hands curling to fists.\\n\\n“I should… come with you.”\\n\\nHe spoke with uncertainty, most likely his inner-wolf was fighting for its true mate. He stared down at me huddled on the passenger seat, a possessive glint in his previously soft eyes. I shook my head, silently.\\n\\nThe instinctual part of me wanted him to stay close and I didn’t have the strength to tell him no. I glanced at Ignatious - pleading with my eyes for him to handle the situation swiftly. He gave me a small nod and put a warning hand on Johan’s shoulder.\\n\\n“She’ll be fine, you can visit her later if you need to.”\\n\\nFor a second it looked like Johan would get violent, glancing angrily at the cool hand on his shoulder. Ignatius removed his hand and folded his arms, “Isn’t Mavis going to be wondering where you are?”\\n\\nThis seemed to shake Johan out of his volatile state. He stepped away and allowed Ignatius to close the passenger door. With one final glance in my direction he turned and left, heading back into the college and rubbing an arm over his eyes.\\n\\nIgnatius stared after him for a while before rounding the car and climbing into the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n“Put your seatbelt on.”\\n\\nIt took me a moment or two to realize he was obviously talking to me. I turned my gaze from the window and Johan’s retreating figure to face my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“Uh, potentially fractured rib cage?”\\n\\nI didn’t mean for it to sound quite so condescending but the interaction with Johan and my still aching body had left me in a sour mood. Ignatius started the car and pulled out of the parking bay.\\n\\n“Fair point. Here, for your face.”\\n\\nHe handed me a towel from the back seat and I pressed it to my dripping nose. The rest of the car ride was a silent one, albeit not wholly unpleasant. Ignatius’s scent was as comforting as it was intoxicating.\\n\\nThe salty tint of a sea breeze was detectable even through a nose clogged with blood. He flicked on the radio at some point and I closed my eyes, leaning back in the seat and allowing myself to drift pleasantly into unconsciousness.\\n\\n~Johan~\\n\\nTearing myself from Dorothy had been more difficult than I expected. Walking back into college I made straight for an empty lecture room and slammed the door behind me, harder than I had intended to - the wood splintered slightly and it creaked on its hinges in protest.\\n\\nPlanting my palms on an empty desk I ran through the events of today in my head. I had been able to sense her from the moment I awoke that morning. As much as I had believed I was ready for the mating call, her floral scent was overpowering.\\n\\nWaiting in the hallway earlier while she hesitated to approach me, I felt as if I was standing in an open field. She smelled of fresh air and sprawling pastures, lavender, and light rain. My inner-wolf craved her as I fought to keep my head down, scanning the notes gripped in my fists without actually reading anything.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes from her for long but I was scrambling desperately for the right words to say. I hadn’t expected her to run away, although I couldn’t really blame her.\\n\\nStanding there and pretending that every cell in my body wasn’t singing for her, I couldn’t have given the best first impression.\\n\\nDorothy was perfect though. Talking to her up close - holding her - I could have betrayed Mavis then and there. But we had promised; if Mavis was not my true mate and she wasn’t mine, we would reject our mates and stay together.\\n\\nA duo for years, we had spoken about this day, even as children. When I was nine I crafted her a ring made of twigs and dandelions and swore that one day I would marry her. I loved Mavis, I always would. I couldn’t abandon her for a mate I had only known for half a day.\\n\\nAnd then there was Ignatius. I knew he’d be coming to visit, our fathers had been fast friends for years and Ignatius and I were essentially brothers. Why then would he be hanging around Dorothy? Why would he be holding her? Why was she so eager to go with him?\\n\\nFurthermore, she’d been bleeding. Did he hurt her? How dare he lay a finger on my mate. Friend or no friend I wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart if he so much as -\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with my index finger and thumb. I had let my inner-wolf dictate my emotions. I felt possessive and infuriated at another man near my true mate. But Dorothy wasn’t mine to possess - I had told her so myself.\\n\\nObviously, Ignatius didn’t know about the mating bond, he was just helping out a girl he’d met. And Dorothy had every right to be wary of me, I’d given her nothing but mixed signals and a terrible birthday. I felt torn, tormented. It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult.\\n\\n“So this is where you’ve been hiding.”\\n\\nI hadn’t heard anyone enter, but Mavis was standing behind me with folded arms.\\n\\nShe wore a flowing green sundress and a frown on her face. She waltzed up beside me and hoisted herself onto the desk, swinging her legs beneath her.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you.”\\n\\nI came to stand in front of her and she opened her legs to welcome me. Leaning forwards, I buried my face in her neck and inhaled the scent of her skin and brilliant blonde locks. She smelled of conditioner and expensive fragrance.\\n\\nI didn’t mind the fake floral odor though. I needed reassurance. I needed to remind myself that this was the right decision.\\n\\nMavis ran her fingers through my hair.\\n\\n“So you found her.”\\n\\nHer plump lips brushed my ear.\\n\\n“Your true mate?”\\n\\nI wrapped my arms around her. I wanted to melt into her, assimilate into one being that had no true mate and no mating call to deny. “Yeah. How did you know?”\\n\\nShe blew a raspberry on my neck. I knew she was rolling her eyes without needing to see them.\\n\\n“Allisa obviously. Said she saw you two in the bathroom. And the garden. She said you were holding her.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a moment, waiting for me to deny it. I tightened my embrace and squeezed my eyes shut.\\n\\n“It wasn’t like that. I was honest and she was hurt, I was just trying to be nice.”\\n\\nMavis pulled away and looked me in the eye.\\n\\n“Did you reject her?”\\n\\nIt was hard to keep eye contact. I had never been able to lie to her and this time was no different. I cupped her delicate face in my hand, “Not exactly…”\\n\\nMavis pulled away again and moved to stand up.\\n\\n“Not entirely,” I continued, “But I told her I couldn’t be with her. I love you, Mavis -” I gripped her waist, holding her in place, “I love you.”\\n\\nHer green-gray eyes were piercing and angry, her lips twisted into a sneer, “Then why didn’t you reject her?” she hissed.\\n\\nI straightened up and pressed my palms to my eyes in frustration.\\n\\n“She asked me not to do it today. She was crying, Mavis. What difference does it make if I do it tomorrow instead?”\\n\\nMavis slid off of the desk and stood before me. She pounded a fist on my chest.\\n\\n“You don’t want to reject her, do you? You selfish prick, you can’t ignore the mating call. All of your promises were a bunch of lies.”\\n\\nShe was shorter than me but it felt like she was towering above me, her words like daggers.\\n\\n“Just admit it. You don’t want to ignore it because you’re weak!”\\n\\nI gripped both her wrists in my hand and pressed her fingers to my lips. “I’ll do it, okay? I’ll reject her. You just need to give me some time.”\\n\\nMavis narrowed her eyes and regarded me coldly. She jutted her chin out and yanked her hands away, “I’m the only one who understands you. Not your dad, not your friends, not her. I’m all you’ve got.”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\nI lowered my head, I just wanted it all to be over. This day, this argument, my feelings towards Dorothy. All of it.\\n\\n“I’m the only person who truly cares about you,” Mavis continued, “Who stood by you all these years? Me, I did. I charmed your father, I got along with your useless friends. I got you the status you have today.” She brought her face up to mine and gripped my chin, forcing me to look her in the eye, “Without me you’re nothing.”\\n\\nI knew I shouldn’t let her talk to me like that, but she was right about everything. We needed each other. We had always taken care of each other.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Besides,” Mavis moved her hand to caress my cheek, her eyes softening slightly, “She could never love you like I can.”\\n\\nShe pressed her lips to mine and lassoed her arms around my neck. I leaned into her kiss, convincing myself that if I could just stay close to her, everything would be alright. Mavis pulled me towards her as she backed up against the desk.\\n\\nLost in the moment and determined to push Dorothy out of my mind completely, I hoisted Mavis up onto the desk and she wrapped her slender legs around me. She knotted her fists in my hair and kissed me passionately.\\n\\nI let my hands wander and gripped her thighs under her dress, relishing in the taste of her tongue pushing into my mouth. She pulled at my jeans and moaned for more.\\n\\nWhen I finally pushed into her she sighed into my ear, “Don’t leave me. Promise me you won’t leave me.”\\n\\nI threw my head back in pleasure as she slid her tongue along my neck before kissing her again.\\n\\n“I won’t. I promise.”\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 4\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI was in the woods, standing in a clearing under the silver light of a full moon. I felt safe there at first, bathed in that brilliant glow. I heard something stirring in the darkness of the trees in front of me. Something dangerous.\\n\\nThe slightest hint of a scent was carried to me by the breeze that hushed through the dark and silent forest. The scent of Engelwood and pine. The creature in the dark was approaching. I heard the underbrush rustling as it slowly stalked closer.\\n\\nAll of my senses screamed for me to run, but I was rooted to the spot. I peered into the shadows, trying to catch a glimpse of the unknown being.\\n\\nI glanced down at a sudden sharp movement in my stomach. Something in there wanted to get out. Distracted momentarily by my own body, I looked up again just in time to see the creature with open jaws lurching for my throat.\\n\\nI jerked my body upright as I awoke, inhaling loudly, and looked around wildly for the creature from my dream. Instead, I felt a cool hand on my shoulder and wheeled around, fists swinging, to see Ignatius in the driver’s seat with a look of concern on his face.\\n\\n“You okay? Don’t move so much, you’re still hurt.”\\n\\nIgnatius placed both hands on my shoulders as I continued to shiver, eyes darting all over the place to make sure the creature wasn’t present, “Dorothy? You were dreaming, okay? You’re safe now.”\\n\\nI clung to his forearm, I had to make sure he was real. Ignatius allowed this as I collected my thoughts. After calming down some, I looked around again, “We’re here? How long was I out?”\\n\\nIgnatius removed his hands and sat back in his seat again with an odd look on his face.\\n\\n“Actually we’re just up the road from the clinic. You started thrashing around a little there so I thought I should stop and wake you. Must have been a pretty bad dream?”\\n\\nHe got the car going again and we sped down the street towards the clinic.\\n\\n“Yeah, something like that,” I mumbled, then grimaced as all the pain of my body came rushing back to me at once. Ignatius took my hand and gave it a little squeeze, keeping one steady hand on the wheel.\\n\\n“We’re almost there. This should be a quick fix. And, on top of that, your own healing abilities should be activated by now anyway.”\\n\\nHe had a point. Every wolf-shifter gains enhanced healing abilities around their teenage years, it was the reason no one ever saw the bruises and grazes dealt to me over time - courtesy of Mavis’s posse and Lana’s particularly potent left hook.\\n\\nWhy then was it not working now? The gash in my forehead should have been sealing itself up already but upon close inspection in the rearview mirror, it still remained open and raw.\\n\\nIgnatius seemed to notice as well. He leaned closer, examining my forehead as we drove.\\n\\n“Well. That’s not good.”\\n\\n“What do you mean it’s not good?” My voice betrayed the alarm I was feeling, “What’s wrong with me?”\\n\\nIgnatius shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea, but we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nI looked forward and noticed we’d arrived at the clinic. Because wolf-shifters have different healing abilities compared to the average human, each pack has its own clinic with skilled healers to deal with whatever ailments our bodies can’t fix on their own.\\n\\nAilments like an apparently faulty healing ability. I closed my eyes. Today hadn’t turned out at all like I had expected it to. I should have just stayed in bed.\\n\\nIgnatius refused to let me attempt walking by myself. He carried me through the revolving doors and spoke with the receptionist while I sat mute in his arms, scowling at the wall behind us. If he hadn’t been so helpful today I would have berated him for babying me in that moment.\\n\\nA nurse led us to an empty bed and hurried away again to fetch a healer.\\n\\n“You don’t have to stay,” I said, as Ignatius placed me gently on the crisp sheets and settled into a chair next to me, “Thank you for everything you’ve done but I think I can handle things from here.”\\n\\n“I have time to spare,” Ignatius clasped his hands together and leaned his forearms on his knees, “And thinking about it now, we haven’t even been properly acquainted. You’re a friend of Johan’s?”\\n\\nI shook my head, a part of me was relieved to have company. And something about this boy was incredibly compelling to me.\\n\\n“No. Well, not exactly. How do you know Johan?”\\n\\nUttering his name had my stomach twisting painfully and my inner-wolf shied from the melancholy.\\n\\nBefore Ignatius could answer me, the healer stepped in - a short wrinkled woman with tanned skin and dozens of red beads braided into her hair. She adjusted her glasses and frowned when she saw Ignatius in the chair.\\n\\n“You’re not from here boy. You smell of the sea to the North. Don’t tell me you’re responsible for her injuries?”\\n\\n“He’s not,” I interrupted before Ignatius could answer, “He’s been helping me. He’s a - a friend.”\\n\\nI didn’t really know what Ignatius was to me but the fact that he was sticking around meant a lot, although I would never admit it to myself.\\n\\nThe healer narrowed her eyes at Ignatious who raised both his hands in a mock surrender.\\n\\n“Very well. Let’s take a look at you then.”\\n\\nShe tilted my head back to examine the gash, frowning as she did so. “Odd, this should be healing up already. And I’m told your ribs are hurt too…”\\n\\nI sat quietly while she poked and prodded and tutted around me, raising my eyebrow at Ignatius who mouthed back; “Weird old bat.”\\n\\nI stifled a giggle which in turn had me wincing at the pain it caused me.\\n\\n“You.”\\n\\nThe healer pointed a bony finger at Ignatius without turning around.\\n\\n“I will not hesitate to kick you out of here.”\\n\\nIgnatius leaned back in his chair with a smirk.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of inspecting me and berating Ignatius, the healer came to the conclusion that two of my ribs were fractured and I had suffered a mild concussion.\\n\\n“As for your lack of healing abilities,” she glanced over at Ignatious and back to me, “I can think of a few reasons why that could be. We need to have a talk in private.”\\n\\nShe shooed Ignatius out while he promised me he would be waiting right outside. After she finally got him to leave and shut the door in his face, she turned to me, her eyes were serious and her mouth pressed into a thin line.\\n\\n“Dorothy.”\\n\\nShe came to stand before me.\\n\\n“Have you found your mate yet?”\\n\\nHer question caught me by surprise, there was no way she could have known about today. I stammered out a feeble lie in response, asking what she meant by that. She shook her head.\\n\\n“Don’t lie to me. This is about your healing powers. Did you know your powers could be weakened by a rejection from your true mate?”\\n\\n“He hasn’t rejected me!” I protested, louder than I had intended to.\\n\\n“He hasn’t. Not yet…”\\n\\nThe lump in my throat returned and I was on the brink of tears once again. The healer’s eyes softened slightly and she sat down next to me on the bed.\\n\\n“There’s your problem dear. To go on with or without your mate, if the bond between the two of you is not broken or sealed completely, your abilities will never come back.”\\n\\nI sniffed back a sob, rubbing my eyes, “What are you saying?”\\n\\nShe handed me a tissue and waited a moment while I blew into it - angry at myself for being so fragile.\\n\\n“This mate, whoever he is, you have to break the bond officially. If you don’t, things are only going to get worse for the both of you.”\\n\\nI dropped my head into my hands. Whatever “worse” meant I doubted it could top what I was already feeling.\\n\\n“Your stunted healing is only the beginning,” she continued, gently patting my back. “You have to put an end to this now before you go into heat.”\\n\\nHeat? I didn’t bother asking, too caught up in my own sadness to care about what it meant for my future.\\n\\nAfter patching up my forehead somewhat, the healer left me on my own for a while to cry. She told me they had something to help with the pain, but it would only be a temporary fix. I lay curled up on the bed and let the tears fall.\\n\\nI had to break the bond between Johan and me. I had no choice, asking him not to reject me yet was only temporarily avoiding the inevitable. He didn’t want me. There was no avoiding the bitter truth.\\n\\nI heard someone enter the room and peeked out from under my arm. I was expecting the healer but it was Ignatius kneeling at my bedside.\\n\\n“Christ. What did the old bat say to make you cry like this.”\\n\\nHis eyes were sympathetic but I was appalled to be seen in this state. I buried my face in the pillow and gulped back the tears.\\n\\nIgnatius wasn’t having it though and touched my arm gently.\\n\\n“Hey, Dorothy. What did she say?”\\n\\nI couldn’t tell him. Couldn’t find the words to explain the pain that I was feeling.\\n\\nIgnatius hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Does any of this have something to do with Johan? I know it was his girlfriend’s group who attacked you.”\\n\\nI lifted my arm to look at him again. It felt like his blue eyes were boring into my soul. The ceiling fan above us creaked softly as it spun lazily on its axel. I rolled onto my back and stared up at it.\\n\\n“Johan is my mate.”\\n\\nIgnatius was silent for a moment. I kept my eyes on the slowly spinning fan. The rusted wings were caked with dust from years of propelling air laced with debris from the forest outside.\\n\\nWhen he finally spoke, he was perplexed.\\n\\n“Johan… is your mate? Well, I guess that explains his aggression when I put you in my car but why were things so stiff between you two? Does he know you’re his mate?”\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut, balling my hands into fists as I relived the moment.\\n\\n“Then why were you attacked,” Ignatius continued, “and… What about Mavis? Did he end things with her?”\\n\\nI turned my face to look at him and it seemed that my somber expression was enough to put a stop to his questioning. I felt a tear roll from my eye and wrestled to keep my voice steady. It was no use though, It came out like a quiet sigh of defeat.\\n\\n“He didn’t end things with Mavis. And he’s not going to. Because he doesn’t want me as his mate. He made that very clear.”\\n\\nIgnatius’s concerned expression was frozen on his face as I continued, “Mavis’s friends attacked me because they saw us together. They knew I was his mate and that Mavis wouldn’t be happy about it.”\\n\\nI touched the gauze on my forehead.\\n\\n“I asked him not to reject me today. But if we don’t break the bond completely, my abilities will never come back. In fact, things are only going to get worse.”\\n\\nI quoted the healer’s words, my tone flat and lifeless.\\n\\nIgnatius was quiet beside me, his face inches from mine where he knelt by the bed. I gave him a small, empty smile and turned my gaze back up to the fan on the ceiling. It spun around and around above me, creaking softly in the otherwise silent room.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 5\\n~Ignatius~\\n\\nMy brief visit to Johan’s neighborhood hadn’t ended up very brief at all. I had only meant to stop by the college for a few minutes to catch up with my old friend.\\n\\nHowever, the moment I noticed the small crew of girls heading towards a solitary figure on the outskirts of the college campus, I knew something bad was about to go down.\\n\\nSpotting Claudia, Mavis’s top watchdog, amongst them only confirmed my suspicions. Claudia was ruthless and whoever she was after now was not in for a good time.\\n\\nI had already started towards the group when they began their beatdown. Breaking into a run, I could just make out a small figure curled on the ground and a shock of fiery red hair. Dorothy, I would come to learn, was her name.\\n\\nCarrying her in my arms, I found myself enveloped in her scent. The smell of fresh air and gentle rain - floral and enticing. I wasn’t sure why Claudia and her gang had chosen this particular slip of a girl as their newest victim but I was enraged at their brutality all the same.\\n\\nIf I hadn’t had Dorothy in my arms I would have tracked them down and broken more than just a few of their manicured nails. Then again, considering the fragile allyship between their pack and ours, It wouldn’t look very good for the son of the Northern pack leader to launch an attack on a few Southerner girls.\\n\\nGaging from Dorothy’s nonchalant reaction to the ordeal, it was clear that she bore the brunt of their bullying quite often. Often enough to get used to it. And then there was Johan, I had never seen him act so strange as he had, standing there in the parking lot.\\n\\nWe had been fast friends for years. But around this girl, he had been on edge and angry - prepared to fight. We had fought often as children, even as young teens. But this Johan was different, territorial, and on edge.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after that when I learned why. Dorothy was his true mate. Thinking about it afterward, his possessive, primal attitude should have been a clear sign of that fact. He clearly wanted her. And his inner-wolf must have been seething at another man handling his mate. An Alpha at that.\\n\\nI had felt a pang of guilt at my own actions after Dorothy revealed the truth to me. I hadn’t intended to upset my friend or take what his inner-wolf demanded was his.\\n\\nBut with that being said, Dorothy was hurt and in need of assistance, and - in that volatile state - Johan would have been no help in the situation at best and a danger to Dorothy at worst.\\n\\nFurthermore, I was astonished at his rejection of Dorothy, albeit not an official one. I had met Mavis on multiple occasions and while I could admit she was pretty, the venom in her eyes was clear as day to me.\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom rejecting one’s true mate for a woman so potently cruel. My heart ached for Dorothy. I had only known her for a few hours at most but I had been rocked by the urge to protect her from the moment I laid eyes on her brilliant red hair and caught her faint scent on the breeze.\\n\\nTo lose a mate was an indescribable pain. I had felt it myself once. Unlike Dorothy, I hadn’t been rejected, but a stormy night and a fatal car accident had snatched them away from me. There is no pain quite like that of losing what you love the most.\\n\\nThe memory of that affliction was locked away in the furthermost corners of my mind - only to be carefully opened and examined over and over again in the quiet confines of my own bedroom in the dead of night.\\n\\nWhile I couldn’t entirely understand Dorothy’s pain, I could empathize. Watching her tears fall freely as she lay on the bed in that clinic, I fought the overwhelming urge to take her in my arms again.\\n\\nIt hurt to see her so clearly suffering. I wanted nothing more than to fix what was broken and witness a smile - a real smile - as I was sure it would be a beautiful one. Dorothy, however, was not mine to embrace. I was little more than a stranger to her.\\n\\nAll the same, it was difficult to keep my distance and I reached for her small, slender hand. Dorothy refused to look at me for a moment, keeping her eyes trained to the fan on the ceiling and denying my sympathies with a tight-lipped frown. Her fingers, however, closed around mine and she gripped my hand tightly.\\n\\nWe stayed like that for a good long while, comforted by quiet company, before the healer returned with a handful of what looked like powdery sticks and a vile of inky black liquid. Dorothy tried to get up and I propped a hand on her back, easing her into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe gave me a small smile in response and blinked away the tears that had been building on her long, light lashes.\\n\\n“Now then,” the old bat huffed.\\n\\n“Take this three times a day.”\\n\\nShe held the vile to Dorothy’s face.\\n\\nDorothy grimaced at the black liquid sloshing inside the glass, “No more than one teaspoon, or you’ll knock yourself out for hours. And this-” She held up the powdery sticks and snapped them in half under Dorothy’s nose.\\n\\nA shimmer of gray and brown powder burst from the sticks and Dorothy choked and spluttered as she inhaled it, “What - what was that!” she gasped hoarsely, bringing a hand to her chest.\\n\\n“Sugersnap Thyme. Helps with pain.”\\n\\nThe healer waved the sticks around a little more before tucking them away again, “It might make you a little drowsy and disorientated so I suggest you have your young, seaweed-smelling friend take you home.”\\n\\nShe looked pointedly at me over her glasses and I nodded in response, “Yes, Ma’am.”\\n\\n“Uh-Uh,” Dorothy piped up in protest, “not home. I don’t wanna go home.”\\n\\nHer words slurred a little at the end as the old bat’s magic sticks seemed to be taking effect. She lolled forwards and I rushed to catch her, scooping her up and holding her against my chest.\\n\\n“Don’t wanna go home,” she mumbled into my neck and I could hear the stubborn pout in her voice as she said it.\\n\\n“That’s okay, you can stay at my place for a little if you want.”\\n\\nI could see the old bat eyeing me suspiciously, “I’m staying at a villa for the weekend. Right up the road,” I continued as she narrowed her eyes at me. She thought it over for a moment.\\n\\n“Fine,” she eventually relented, handing me the bottle of putrid-looking medicine. “But be sure to let her parents know. Their number should be in the books at the front desk. Everyone in the pack is.”\\n\\nI took the bottle and thanked her for all of her help.\\n\\n“And you be good to that girl,” she continued, “I’ll be checking in later,” I promised to be on my best behavior. Dorothy grumbled out a half-assed thank you and something about a monster in the forest.\\n\\nAfter finding her name scribbled next to multiple home addresses and five different numbers in the big book at the front desk, I carried a very disorientated Dorothy to my car and somehow managed to get her into the passenger seat without bumping her rolling head on the way in.\\n\\nClimbing into the driver’s seat, I heard her say something about a creature in the dark.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nI leaned over to hear her better, buckling her seatbelt at the same time - she wouldn’t feel her ribs aching right now and I didn’t trust her to not topple off the seat entirely on the drive. Instead of answering, she scoffed at me and leaned her head against the window with drooping lids.\\n\\n“Alrighty then.”\\n\\nI spent the drive home calling all five numbers I’d saved on my phone, one at a time. The first three didn’t answer but on the second to last number a gruff-sounding woman told me to try the last number, explaining that she had been Dorothy’s foster mom for a while.\\n\\nShe also mysteriously griped about a pet frog and an expensive cheese platter before hanging up. The final number rang for half a second before someone picked up and I heard a frantic woman’s voice crackle through the phone, “Dorothy?”\\n\\n“Not quite. This is Ignatius Aamodt. Dorothy’s okay, she’s just had a bit of a rough day.”\\n\\n“Ignatius… Elliot’s son?”\\n\\nIt seemed the Southern Pack was well informed about their new allies.\\n\\n“That’s the one. Are you Dorothy’s foster mother?”\\n\\n“Anita, yes. Where is Dorothy? She was supposed to be back by now. Are you her mate -”\\n\\nShe stopped herself, possibly concerned that she’d said too much.\\n\\n“No, I’m not. It would seem… Things didn’t really go to plan for Dorothy.”\\n\\n“Oh. I had hoped… Nevermind. Where is she now?” There was genuine morosity in her voice.\\n\\nShe seemed to truly care for Dorothy and I found myself wondering if Dorothy herself was aware of that. I looked over at Dorothy, who was currently snoozing in her seat. She swatted the air with one feeble hand and then settled back into her dozing.\\n\\n“Currently snoring in my car. We’re heading to the Blue Villa Hotel on Fort Grayvill, I’ll let Dorothy know to call you when she wakes up.”\\n\\nAfter exchanging addresses with Anita and promising to be in contact I hung up and glanced over at Dorothy again. She looked so tiny and fragile curled up there on the seat. Her hair was making a solid attempt to escape the braid it was caught in, cascading down her shoulder and sticking out in little curling wisps of red and gold.\\n\\nHer skin had a pale, almost translucent glow to it and she had the tiniest smattering of freckles over her nose. The tiny opal knotted on a thin string around her neck was the color of her eyes. Eyes that were now scrunched closed like she was fighting monsters in her dreams.\\n\\nMy thoughts wandered back to the nightmare I’d woken her from earlier. The creature in the woods she’d said, or something to that extent. Something about this girl had sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to know more about her.\\n\\nTo get to know her. I wanted to know if she preferred strawberries or orange slices, winter or spring. I wanted to get to know Dorothy, although I wasn’t entirely sure why.\\n\\nI found myself so deep in my musings I almost missed the turnoff to the villa I’d rented out for the duration of my stay. I could have stayed with my father in the fancier hotel further on. But the thought of waking up to Elliot’s cold demeanor every morning was daunting and I was weak in that regard.\\n\\nI pulled the car into the parking area and tried to wake Dorothy up. Her eyelids fluttered and I caught a glimpse of those striking opal irises before she was out once more. Getting out and rounding the car, I unbuckled her and lifted her to my chest again.\\n\\nDorothy wrapped both arms around my neck and sighed into my ear, still half asleep and much less indignant about me carrying her than she would have been if she was awake. Her breath on my neck sent shivers down my spine and her scent was stronger than ever.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun was sending slanted rays of light through the trees nearby and made her hair look even brighter, radiating in the golden glow. Turning to head into the villa I noticed another car parked in the empty bay beside mine. A familiar car. My gaze shot to the entrance of the villa where Johan was leaning against the door with folded arms.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha ”🤩🤩', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔥Read the full version👉Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'KeenNovels', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101464925740704', 'page_likes': 28, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101464925740704', 'ads_count': 14, 'cumulative_ads_count': 14, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:09:54', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Bats and jackals, bears and cats. Vampires, so unnatural in their beauty and strength. But none are more powerful than the wolf shifters. With both instinct and human intelligence, so intertwined with nature and humankind itself, we are more of this earth than you are.\\n\\nI don’t remember much of my mother or pack, but I remember her stories of our kinds’ abilities and the enemies that plague us. Not wholly evil, and not entirely good, those tales haunted my nightmares and dreams alike for years after I was too old for bedtime stories and forgot my mother’s face entirely.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 1\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI awoke that morning with a twisting knot of anxiety in my stomach. I rolled onto my side under the covers and clung to my pillow tightly before heaving in a deep breath and getting up. Today was my eighteenth birthday. Today, I would find my mate.\\n\\nStanding up I examined myself in the mirror, frowning at the spindly pale girl gazing back at me. I wondered if a mate would reject their match based on looks alone. I pulled my hair up into a ponytail before exhaling through my nose and letting it fall loose around my shoulders again.\\n\\nThe bright red locks only made me look paler. I could sense my mate, it seemed they were nearby.\\n\\nIf they didn’t come looking for me there was a good chance I would find them first - their scent almost palatable on my tongue. Already my inner-wolf seemed to crave them, rearing to seek them out. Whoever it was.\\n\\nI could sense something odd about my new mate. While all the desire and enthrallment were present on my side, something about their energy felt off. Things were off to a great start, I thought, tensely pulling at a strand of hair.\\n\\nDespite my nervousness, I couldn’t help the excitement bubbling up inside my chest. I had waited for this day since I had been old enough to understand the mating call. I had wanted this day since I was old enough to want for anything. To be wanted…\\n\\nI was snapped out of my pondering by a quiet knock on my bedroom door. Anita, my current caretaker poked her head in and gave me a small smile.\\n\\n“Today’s the day,” Anita didn’t step into the room - the relationship too short and unfamiliar for affections of any kind, “Are you excited?”\\n\\nI turned back to the mirror and glowered at my reflection.\\n\\n“More like sick to my stomach. What if they don’t like me?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” Anita tutted, brushing the air, “Whoever it is, they’re your mate. And besides, you’re a beautiful girl on top of all that spunk of yours.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile a little. Passed around from foster home to foster home, I had only known Anita for a little over a month at that point, but her kind words eased my quivering nerves slightly.\\n\\nAnita promised to whip up an extra special breakfast - “waffles and hashbrowns!” - before leaving me to get ready for college.\\n\\nAlone and overwhelmed again, I was torn between putting on my best outfits and attempting some kind of make-up endeavor, or treating today like any other day and donning my regular jeans and turtleneck.\\n\\nIn the end, I went for my standard attire with some added rings and necklaces to convey some sort of actual effort.\\n\\nLastly, I swept my fiery hair into a rough braid and pinned the loose wisps back with a collection of different colored clips. After forcing down a bite or two of steaming waffle I assured Anita I would have the rest when I returned and headed out to campus.\\n\\nThe local college was a ten-minute walk from my current home and I spent the entire trip going over introductions in my head.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I’m your mate.”\\n\\nSounded way too formal.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it to campus, I was a quaking bundle of nerves. I wasn’t even entirely sure that my mate went to this college. Although considering it was the only college attended by every young wolf-shifter of the nearby packs, it was highly likely.\\n\\nOn top of that, my inner-wolf grew even more agitated the second I stepped inside. My mate was close, I could smell the hint of pine and englewood in their scent.\\n\\nBefore I had half a chance to look, it was time to head to class. I spent the first hour relentlessly gnawing on the end of my pen and meticulously fiddling with my braid until the whole thing looked like a frazzled mess. All the while running through various introductions to no avail.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I think I’m your mate?”\\n\\nToo timid. I groaned loud enough to startle the dozing boy sitting next to me and plopped my head down onto the desk in defeat.\\n\\nAfter two more hours of barely containing my growing excitement, I was finally free to stalk the campus, following the comforting scent of my soon-to-be mate.\\n\\nI kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the other students who jostled around me in the corridors. I wasn’t particularly popular at this school and people passed me by like I was invisible.\\n\\nThe scent was stronger now, I knew my mate was close. Turning a corner I shivered in anticipation. My legs felt like jelly and my small bites of breakfast were threatening to crawl back up my throat. Then, suddenly, there he was. I knew he was my mate the second I lay eyes on him.\\n\\nHe was leaning against the wall in front of me, flipping through a stack of notes like he didn’t know what else to do with himself. Johan, a gentle Beta of the Kall Pack - it was very likely that he didn’t know of me at all. But I knew him. I was also uncomfortably aware that his girlfriend was the prettiest she-wolf in their pack.\\n\\nI was stunned. I stood there for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the boy in front of me. He hadn’t noticed me yet - but surely he could sense me?\\n\\nJohan ran a hand through his hair - short wavy locks the color of wheat - and continued flipping through pages with a furrowed brow. My courage failing me, I took a small step back.\\n\\nMy inner-wolf raged in response but my mind was suddenly flooded with doubt. Why couldn’t he sense my presence? Maybe he could, but didn’t want to acknowledge me. Surely he would leave his girlfriend now that it was clear that I was his true mate? I took another step back into the shadows of the hallway, preparing to leave.\\n\\nSuddenly, Johan raised his head and looked straight at me. Gentle brown eyes locked with mine and he gave a half-smile that accentuated the dimple in his cheek. Overwhelmed and caught off guard, I turned tail and sprinted back down the way I’d come.\\n\\nIt was all too much. I couldn’t think straight. A million thoughts shot through my mind as I ran, my sneakers squeaking on the laminated floors.\\n\\nJohan was perfect. He was soft and kind and absolutely gorgeous. But he wasn’t mine. Fighting back tears as I made my way to the bathrooms, rushing into a cubicle and slamming the door shut behind me.\\n\\nI pressed my forehead to the cool concrete of the stall and tried to organize my thoughts. Johan was my mate - Johan knew that I was his. He had to. But Johan also had a girlfriend - Mavis - someone who was miles ahead of me in terms of looks, status, and charisma. Mavis who, along with her posse of beautiful airheads, had bullied me since I had joined their pack as a kid.\\n\\nI slid to the floor and put my head on my knees. I thought I would be ready for this day. Today was supposed to be perfect. Today I was supposed to finally belong somewhere.\\n\\nA few treacherous tears escaped and slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away roughly and sniffed. A sudden knock on the cubicle door had me jumping in my skin.\\n\\n“Um, Dorothy?”\\n\\nA quiet voice from the other side, a voice like milk and honey, “Hey, um, Dorothy could you come out here? I promise I won’t bite.”\\n\\nI could hear the grin in Johan’s voice at that last part. His scent, so close and comforting, enveloped me. Hesitantly, I got to my feet, wiping my teary eyes on my sleeve, and opened the door slightly. I peaked out at the boy standing at the door, and he chuckled at my dramatic pouting.\\n\\n“Geez, you run away and frown at me before we’ve even been properly introduced?”\\n\\nHis words were chiding but his tone was light and there was a humorous glimmer in his eye. I swung the door fully open and came to stand in front of him. I stared down at my shoes, hoping he wouldn’t notice my reddened eyes.\\n\\n“I just… didn’t know what to say.”\\n\\nI still didn’t, really. Standing before this beautiful boy, my true mate, all of my confidence went out the window along with my ability to form sentences.\\n\\n“Well, we can start slow,” Johan offered me his hand, “Would you mind if we talk somewhere else? As much as I’d love to hang around the girl’s bathroom I don’t think the ladies will be particularly happy with my being here.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took Johan’s hand and let him guide me out of the bathroom and through the throngs of students towards the small indoor garden.\\n\\nHe sat down on the creaking wooden bench and gestured for me to join him. I plonked down next to him and immediately berated myself mentally for not even trying to be graceful. Johan didn’t seem to mind though and he leaned back on the bench, folding his arms and cocking his chin to gaze at me.\\n\\n“So… my name is Johan-”\\n\\nI couldn’t help a short laugh, cutting him off, and waved my hand to dismiss his introduction.\\n\\n“I know who you are. Everyone here knows who you are. You’re the pack’s golden boy with the bombshell girlfriend and a father on the council. I would have been living under a rock all this time if I didn’t know your name.”\\n\\nJohan smirked and raised an eyebrow at me. “Okay, my reputation precedes me, it would seem.”\\n\\nI breathed a quiet sigh of relief that my interruption didn’t seem to offend him.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Johan continued, “You’re Dorothy right? I’ve seen you around campus a few times,” He laughed at my incredulous expression, “Your hair is a little hard to miss.”\\n\\nI blushed brighter than my locks at that comment and twisted my braid between my fingers. We spoke for a while, I explained that I had been moving between foster homes since I’d been left with the pack as a small child.\\n\\nJohan told me about his father’s strict parenting that landed him with his “golden boy” persona in the first place.\\n\\nAs we talked, I felt myself begin to relax, comfortable in Johan’s calm presence. The excitement I had felt earlier that morning was back and I couldn’t help but smile openly while speaking with my true mate.\\n\\nJohan spoke with a laid-back, boyish attitude and waved his hands around while describing how he and an old friend had once been chased around the woods by a jackal they’d mistaken for a wolf-shifter when they were children.\\n\\nI in turn gave him a dramatic retelling of the story about a pet frog I’d once had and how it had gotten into one of my caretaker’s handbags on their big, fancy date night.\\n\\nAfter a while, Johan’s tone grew more serious and he took my hand in his. I felt prickles of electricity where his skin touched mine and I looked into his chocolate brown eyes in earnest. This was it. He was going to accept me as his mate.\\n\\nI could barely contain my excitement and I could feel my inner-wolf singing in my chest. Johan’s expression, however, was puzzling - almost sympathetic.\\n\\n“Dorothy, you’re beautiful. You’re ‘perfect’. I can feel the connection we have and I know now that you are my true mate. You always have been. But…” he hesitated - wincing like the words hurt to force out, “But I already love someone else - Mavis, her and I… we promised we’d stay together.”\\n\\nIt felt as if a carpet had been pulled from beneath my feet but instead of the ground, there was only open space. I pulled my hand away from Johan even though it pained me to do it.\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\nMy voice cracked slightly, and my eyes pricked with tears once more.\\n\\nJohan’s face contorted as he fought to keep his voice steady, “Dorothy...”\\n\\nI leaned away from him, shaking my head and covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to hear it. I couldn’t. Johan took my face in his hands, using a thumb to wipe a tear that was trailing down my cheek.\\n\\n“Dorothy, I can’t accept you as my mate. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nJohan held onto me as I burst into tears, burying my face in his chest and soaking in his scent while I still could.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 2\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nIt was a long while before my wailing petered out into quiet sobs. I leaned into Johan who had his arms around me, stroking my hair and cradling my shaking frame. I inhaled against his neck and clutched the fabric of his shirt with trembling hands.\\n\\n“Please, don’t reject me yet. Not today.”\\n\\nMy voice was hoarse, a little more than a whisper as I clung to him, “Let me at least have today, even if it’s fake.”\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom a rejection so monumental. Not here, alone on campus where everyone could witness the aftermath. And not today - it was too much to bear.\\n\\nJohan was silent for a moment, rocking me gently as he thought it over.\\n\\n“Alright. Not today.”\\n\\nHe squeezed my shoulders tightly before releasing me and standing up, “I should get going. Again, I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nHe reached out as if to touch my hair, but drew his hand away abruptly, shoving it into his pocket instead. Turning with jerky movements, Johan left the garden and disappeared into the bustling corridor without another word.\\n\\nI stared after him, motionless and empty. My inner-wolf cried in anguish deep inside of my chest. I felt numb, my tears used up, and what little hope I had left was shattered entirely.\\n\\nA part of me wanted to scream and cry for Johan to come back. To beg him to stay. But I was exhausted, and the small voice in the back of my mind was whispering that I shouldn’t have expected anything else. That I would never be wanted. That I would never belong.\\n\\nHeaving myself off the bench, I left the garden on legs that felt like lead. The thought of more classes after what had just happened was unbearable. I slipped out of the college instead and headed towards the woods just outside of campus. Going home wasn’t an option either.\\n\\nAlthough Anita would be understanding, her sympathetic smile would only make me feel worse. In that moment, I just wanted to be alone. I scuffed my sneaker on the tarmac and inhaled the fresh scent of the woods before me. Pine and Engelwood, just like him. I pushed the thought from my mind.\\n\\nBefore I could make it to the woods, however, I heard multiple sets of footsteps catching up behind me and turned to see five of Mavis’s crew heading my way. Why now?\\n\\nI contemplated running, but among the group, I’d spotted Lana, who, with her long slender limbs and athletic abilities had always managed to run me down before.\\n\\nI didn’t see this time going any differently. Instead, I slowed my pace and let them catch up with me, forming a half-circle between their prey and the forest. I folded my arms and prepared to defend myself.\\n\\n“Hello, gingersnap, what has you running out here with your tail between your legs?” Claudia, the speaker in question, donned a malicious fake smile while she blinked at me.\\n\\n“Well hello Claudia, why don’t you mind your own business for once?” I sneered back, “Doesn’t Mavis need her guard dogs today?”\\n\\nI hoped they couldn’t hear the tremble in my voice. Hoped they wouldn’t notice my puffy eyes and tear-streaked face.\\n\\nHatred flashed in Claudia’s eyes and she prodded my chest with one perfectly manicured nail, “I heard somebody found her mate today,” she said in a sing-song voice and poked me again, harder this time.\\n\\nI smacked her hand away. “That’s got nothing to do with any of you.”\\n\\nCladia retracted her clawed hand and coked her head to the side. “Oh, but it does. I heard you were getting quite cozy with Johan over in the gardens earlier. And Alissa said she even saw the two of you leave the bathroom together. Didn’t you Alissa?”\\n\\nShe looked over at the bottle blonde to her left who shrugged and nodded vaguely like the entire conversation disinterested her.\\n\\n“It’s not what you think, he doesn’t even want -” My words came out jumbled and I cut myself off, unable to voice the painful truth.\\n\\nClaudia made no effort to conceal the joy this torment brought her. A cold grin settled across her face. “He doesn’t want you.”\\n\\nWith that, I decided I had had enough. I pushed past the tall girl and made for the canopy of the forest. Claudia clearly wasn’t letting me go that easily though and she gripped my shirt at the shoulder, yanking me backward and sending me to the ground before I could steady myself.\\n\\nClaudia was strong. Inhumanly strong. She was using the strength of her inner-wolf and she was all the more dangerous for it.\\n\\nI landed on my back and immediately tried to scramble to my feet only for Claudia to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach with her pointed boot. I buckled, winded, and collapsed to my knees. I had no time to gasp for air before Lana delivered another kick to my side, and sent me sprawling on the tarmac again.\\n\\nClaudia reached down, grabbing my hair, and yanked my head up to face the girls. “We couldn’t care less about you or who you decide to pine over. But you got a little too close to Mavis’s man and we can’t allow that.”\\n\\nWith that, she slammed my head against the ground causing stars to explode across my vision and blood to pour from both my nose and a nasty new gash in my brow. The girls continued their assault, taunting and jeering while I curled up on my side in an attempt to protect myself.\\n\\nI could barely think straight, my mind was foggy and I cried out at every jab and kick that hit its mark. It felt like they were aiming to kill. I had endured their torment time and time again but this time they weren’t holding back.\\n\\nThe attack went on for what felt like forever when suddenly, through the fog I heard a new voice speak up.\\n\\n“What the fuck is going on here?”\\n\\nA voice so low and dangerous. A voice like ice.\\n\\nThe girls halted their attack and a new scent washed over me - overpowering and intoxicating, it was a musky rose with the echo of a sea breeze. I couldn’t see this new stranger from my fetal position on the ground but I could sense him with every fiber of my being.\\n\\nThe hair on my neck rose and my heart slowed into deep rhythmic beats that reverberated through my entire body.\\n\\n“Who are you supposed to b-” I heard Lana start before she was abruptly cut off by Claudia.\\n\\n“Let’s go. Now.”\\n\\nThere was genuine fear in her voice.\\n\\nI could hear them hurry away, and unfolded myself to catch a glimpse of the stranger who’d saved me. The blood from the wound to my head had dripped down into my eyes and made it difficult to see. I squinted in the direction of the dominating scent and feebly rubbed at my eyes.\\n\\nStanding over me was a boy whose appearance matched the tone of his voice. Cold, and unsettling. His hair was snow white and ruffled like it was caught in a perpetual gust of wind. Dark brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes that were gazing down intently at me.\\n\\n“Who - argh!” I tried to get to my feet but a sharp fiery pain in my side kept me down.\\n\\n“Try not to move too much.” The stranger knelt down and slid a hand between my head and the rough ground, “Looks like they did a number on your ribs.”\\n\\nI winced as he tilted my head slightly to examine the bleeding cut, “Didn’t go easy on your face either,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nI groaned as another sharp pain shot through my side. The bleeding from my nose had slowed but there was no doubt that I looked like a god-awful mess.\\n\\n“Someone should see to that. Do you think you can stand?”\\n\\nThe stranger frowned as I tried to get to my knees and failed miserably, clutching my side and moaning in frustration.\\n\\n“Guess not. Why did those girls have it out for you anyway?” he asked while slinging my arm over his shoulder and lifting me to my feet. He went a step further and swung an arm under my knees, lifting me off the ground and cradling me in his arms.\\n\\nHe took care to be gentle around my aching ribs and headed back towards the college campus. Too tired and injured to be embarrassed, I rested my head against his chest - a chest like warm marble.\\n\\n“They’ve never really needed a reason to do what they do.”\\n\\nI didn’t feel like explaining the truth. I had had enough humiliation for one day without explaining my mate’s rejection to an odd stranger. The answer seemed satisfying enough to him though as he shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n“Typical. Anyway, we need to get you to a doctor. Make sure nothing is broken.”\\n\\n“Hmm.”\\n\\nI was only half-listening, fatigue catching up with me after the events of the day. On top of that, I found I was quite enjoying this boy’s strange scent.\\n\\nAnother wave of pain snapped me out of my trance and I swiveled my head to gaze up at the guy’s face. From this angle, his jawline looked like the edge of a cliff. Everything about him seemed sharp enough to cut.\\n\\n“Who exactly are you?” I asked tentatively. I’d never seen him around before. I was sure I would have remembered a face like that.\\n\\n“Ignatius. I’m from the Allied Pack further North but my father is down here for an Elders meeting. Thought I’d tag along and visit some old friends.”\\n\\nHe glanced down, raising one dark eyebrow at me, “And who are you, little Miss five-on-one?”\\n\\nHis gaze had my stomach twisting in knots and my inner-wolf was stirring in response to this new anomaly. I forced my suddenly gaping mouth closed and looked away.\\n\\n“I’m nobody special.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange name.”\\n\\nHis tone was somehow flat and slightly amused simultaneously. I glowered at his small smirk, wiping my nose where fresh blood was drizzling out.\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy. I’m a part of this area’s pack but not really. And this morning I had waffles and syrup for breakfast.”\\n\\nI turned my nose up and faced away from him again, determined to not share any more of my incredibly mundane current life.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of silent walking and being carried around like a sack of delicate potatoes, I asked, “Do you, like, have a car, or do you plan to walk us to the hospital?”\\n\\nWithout answering, Ignatious rounded the corner with me and fished a set of car keys out of his pocket. Striding up to a flashy, old-school Impala, he unlocked the passenger door and stooped to put me down.\\n\\nBefore he could manage that, however, we were interrupted. A comforting scent, the slightest hint of pine in the air.\\n\\n“Dorothy?”\\n\\nIgnatius turned with me in his arms to face Johan, standing a few feet away.\\n\\n“Dorothy, what happened to you?”\\n\\nGenuine concern in his voice, he seemed as gentle as ever but there was tension in his shoulders and his lips twitched slightly as he eyed Ignatius and his pale arms firmly handling me.\\n\\n“Johan,” Ignatius said nonchalantly, while my head snapped up to look at him so fast I damn near gave myself whiplash, “Long time no see, old friend.”\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 3\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\n“You know each other?” I squeaked, clinging tighter to Ignatius now that Johan’s scent was present and toying with my emotions once again.\\n\\nNeither responded to my question but instead, Johan stepped closer, reaching for me, stiltedly like he couldn’t control his movements. My internal heartbreak still fresh, I cowered away from him into Ignatious’s chest.\\n\\n“I’m okay. Really it’s fine.”\\n\\nI was fighting to keep my tone even but my voice shook slightly.\\n\\n“Um, Ignatious is just helping me out.”\\n\\nIgnatius himself seemed confused by the odd interaction between Johan and me, but thankfully he caught on to the fact that the situation was more than uncomfortable. He proceeded to place me gently in the passenger seat and straightened up to face Johan again.\\n\\n“She was attacked by some students. Gonna take her down to the healer to fix her up.”\\n\\nIgnatius tried to close the passenger door behind him but Johan put a hand out to stop him. He seemed to be wrestling with himself internally, his shoulders shaking and his hands curling to fists.\\n\\n“I should… come with you.”\\n\\nHe spoke with uncertainty, most likely his inner-wolf was fighting for its true mate. He stared down at me huddled on the passenger seat, a possessive glint in his previously soft eyes. I shook my head, silently.\\n\\nThe instinctual part of me wanted him to stay close and I didn’t have the strength to tell him no. I glanced at Ignatious - pleading with my eyes for him to handle the situation swiftly. He gave me a small nod and put a warning hand on Johan’s shoulder.\\n\\n“She’ll be fine, you can visit her later if you need to.”\\n\\nFor a second it looked like Johan would get violent, glancing angrily at the cool hand on his shoulder. Ignatius removed his hand and folded his arms, “Isn’t Mavis going to be wondering where you are?”\\n\\nThis seemed to shake Johan out of his volatile state. He stepped away and allowed Ignatius to close the passenger door. With one final glance in my direction he turned and left, heading back into the college and rubbing an arm over his eyes.\\n\\nIgnatius stared after him for a while before rounding the car and climbing into the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n“Put your seatbelt on.”\\n\\nIt took me a moment or two to realize he was obviously talking to me. I turned my gaze from the window and Johan’s retreating figure to face my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“Uh, potentially fractured rib cage?”\\n\\nI didn’t mean for it to sound quite so condescending but the interaction with Johan and my still aching body had left me in a sour mood. Ignatius started the car and pulled out of the parking bay.\\n\\n“Fair point. Here, for your face.”\\n\\nHe handed me a towel from the back seat and I pressed it to my dripping nose. The rest of the car ride was a silent one, albeit not wholly unpleasant. Ignatius’s scent was as comforting as it was intoxicating.\\n\\nThe salty tint of a sea breeze was detectable even through a nose clogged with blood. He flicked on the radio at some point and I closed my eyes, leaning back in the seat and allowing myself to drift pleasantly into unconsciousness.\\n\\n~Johan~\\n\\nTearing myself from Dorothy had been more difficult than I expected. Walking back into college I made straight for an empty lecture room and slammed the door behind me, harder than I had intended to - the wood splintered slightly and it creaked on its hinges in protest.\\n\\nPlanting my palms on an empty desk I ran through the events of today in my head. I had been able to sense her from the moment I awoke that morning. As much as I had believed I was ready for the mating call, her floral scent was overpowering.\\n\\nWaiting in the hallway earlier while she hesitated to approach me, I felt as if I was standing in an open field. She smelled of fresh air and sprawling pastures, lavender, and light rain. My inner-wolf craved her as I fought to keep my head down, scanning the notes gripped in my fists without actually reading anything.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes from her for long but I was scrambling desperately for the right words to say. I hadn’t expected her to run away, although I couldn’t really blame her.\\n\\nStanding there and pretending that every cell in my body wasn’t singing for her, I couldn’t have given the best first impression.\\n\\nDorothy was perfect though. Talking to her up close - holding her - I could have betrayed Mavis then and there. But we had promised; if Mavis was not my true mate and she wasn’t mine, we would reject our mates and stay together.\\n\\nA duo for years, we had spoken about this day, even as children. When I was nine I crafted her a ring made of twigs and dandelions and swore that one day I would marry her. I loved Mavis, I always would. I couldn’t abandon her for a mate I had only known for half a day.\\n\\nAnd then there was Ignatius. I knew he’d be coming to visit, our fathers had been fast friends for years and Ignatius and I were essentially brothers. Why then would he be hanging around Dorothy? Why would he be holding her? Why was she so eager to go with him?\\n\\nFurthermore, she’d been bleeding. Did he hurt her? How dare he lay a finger on my mate. Friend or no friend I wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart if he so much as -\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with my index finger and thumb. I had let my inner-wolf dictate my emotions. I felt possessive and infuriated at another man near my true mate. But Dorothy wasn’t mine to possess - I had told her so myself.\\n\\nObviously, Ignatius didn’t know about the mating bond, he was just helping out a girl he’d met. And Dorothy had every right to be wary of me, I’d given her nothing but mixed signals and a terrible birthday. I felt torn, tormented. It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult.\\n\\n“So this is where you’ve been hiding.”\\n\\nI hadn’t heard anyone enter, but Mavis was standing behind me with folded arms.\\n\\nShe wore a flowing green sundress and a frown on her face. She waltzed up beside me and hoisted herself onto the desk, swinging her legs beneath her.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you.”\\n\\nI came to stand in front of her and she opened her legs to welcome me. Leaning forwards, I buried my face in her neck and inhaled the scent of her skin and brilliant blonde locks. She smelled of conditioner and expensive fragrance.\\n\\nI didn’t mind the fake floral odor though. I needed reassurance. I needed to remind myself that this was the right decision.\\n\\nMavis ran her fingers through my hair.\\n\\n“So you found her.”\\n\\nHer plump lips brushed my ear.\\n\\n“Your true mate?”\\n\\nI wrapped my arms around her. I wanted to melt into her, assimilate into one being that had no true mate and no mating call to deny. “Yeah. How did you know?”\\n\\nShe blew a raspberry on my neck. I knew she was rolling her eyes without needing to see them.\\n\\n“Allisa obviously. Said she saw you two in the bathroom. And the garden. She said you were holding her.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a moment, waiting for me to deny it. I tightened my embrace and squeezed my eyes shut.\\n\\n“It wasn’t like that. I was honest and she was hurt, I was just trying to be nice.”\\n\\nMavis pulled away and looked me in the eye.\\n\\n“Did you reject her?”\\n\\nIt was hard to keep eye contact. I had never been able to lie to her and this time was no different. I cupped her delicate face in my hand, “Not exactly…”\\n\\nMavis pulled away again and moved to stand up.\\n\\n“Not entirely,” I continued, “But I told her I couldn’t be with her. I love you, Mavis -” I gripped her waist, holding her in place, “I love you.”\\n\\nHer green-gray eyes were piercing and angry, her lips twisted into a sneer, “Then why didn’t you reject her?” she hissed.\\n\\nI straightened up and pressed my palms to my eyes in frustration.\\n\\n“She asked me not to do it today. She was crying, Mavis. What difference does it make if I do it tomorrow instead?”\\n\\nMavis slid off of the desk and stood before me. She pounded a fist on my chest.\\n\\n“You don’t want to reject her, do you? You selfish prick, you can’t ignore the mating call. All of your promises were a bunch of lies.”\\n\\nShe was shorter than me but it felt like she was towering above me, her words like daggers.\\n\\n“Just admit it. You don’t want to ignore it because you’re weak!”\\n\\nI gripped both her wrists in my hand and pressed her fingers to my lips. “I’ll do it, okay? I’ll reject her. You just need to give me some time.”\\n\\nMavis narrowed her eyes and regarded me coldly. She jutted her chin out and yanked her hands away, “I’m the only one who understands you. Not your dad, not your friends, not her. I’m all you’ve got.”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\nI lowered my head, I just wanted it all to be over. This day, this argument, my feelings towards Dorothy. All of it.\\n\\n“I’m the only person who truly cares about you,” Mavis continued, “Who stood by you all these years? Me, I did. I charmed your father, I got along with your useless friends. I got you the status you have today.” She brought her face up to mine and gripped my chin, forcing me to look her in the eye, “Without me you’re nothing.”\\n\\nI knew I shouldn’t let her talk to me like that, but she was right about everything. We needed each other. We had always taken care of each other.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Besides,” Mavis moved her hand to caress my cheek, her eyes softening slightly, “She could never love you like I can.”\\n\\nShe pressed her lips to mine and lassoed her arms around my neck. I leaned into her kiss, convincing myself that if I could just stay close to her, everything would be alright. Mavis pulled me towards her as she backed up against the desk.\\n\\nLost in the moment and determined to push Dorothy out of my mind completely, I hoisted Mavis up onto the desk and she wrapped her slender legs around me. She knotted her fists in my hair and kissed me passionately.\\n\\nI let my hands wander and gripped her thighs under her dress, relishing in the taste of her tongue pushing into my mouth. She pulled at my jeans and moaned for more.\\n\\nWhen I finally pushed into her she sighed into my ear, “Don’t leave me. Promise me you won’t leave me.”\\n\\nI threw my head back in pleasure as she slid her tongue along my neck before kissing her again.\\n\\n“I won’t. I promise.”\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 4\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI was in the woods, standing in a clearing under the silver light of a full moon. I felt safe there at first, bathed in that brilliant glow. I heard something stirring in the darkness of the trees in front of me. Something dangerous.\\n\\nThe slightest hint of a scent was carried to me by the breeze that hushed through the dark and silent forest. The scent of Engelwood and pine. The creature in the dark was approaching. I heard the underbrush rustling as it slowly stalked closer.\\n\\nAll of my senses screamed for me to run, but I was rooted to the spot. I peered into the shadows, trying to catch a glimpse of the unknown being.\\n\\nI glanced down at a sudden sharp movement in my stomach. Something in there wanted to get out. Distracted momentarily by my own body, I looked up again just in time to see the creature with open jaws lurching for my throat.\\n\\nI jerked my body upright as I awoke, inhaling loudly, and looked around wildly for the creature from my dream. Instead, I felt a cool hand on my shoulder and wheeled around, fists swinging, to see Ignatius in the driver’s seat with a look of concern on his face.\\n\\n“You okay? Don’t move so much, you’re still hurt.”\\n\\nIgnatius placed both hands on my shoulders as I continued to shiver, eyes darting all over the place to make sure the creature wasn’t present, “Dorothy? You were dreaming, okay? You’re safe now.”\\n\\nI clung to his forearm, I had to make sure he was real. Ignatius allowed this as I collected my thoughts. After calming down some, I looked around again, “We’re here? How long was I out?”\\n\\nIgnatius removed his hands and sat back in his seat again with an odd look on his face.\\n\\n“Actually we’re just up the road from the clinic. You started thrashing around a little there so I thought I should stop and wake you. Must have been a pretty bad dream?”\\n\\nHe got the car going again and we sped down the street towards the clinic.\\n\\n“Yeah, something like that,” I mumbled, then grimaced as all the pain of my body came rushing back to me at once. Ignatius took my hand and gave it a little squeeze, keeping one steady hand on the wheel.\\n\\n“We’re almost there. This should be a quick fix. And, on top of that, your own healing abilities should be activated by now anyway.”\\n\\nHe had a point. Every wolf-shifter gains enhanced healing abilities around their teenage years, it was the reason no one ever saw the bruises and grazes dealt to me over time - courtesy of Mavis’s posse and Lana’s particularly potent left hook.\\n\\nWhy then was it not working now? The gash in my forehead should have been sealing itself up already but upon close inspection in the rearview mirror, it still remained open and raw.\\n\\nIgnatius seemed to notice as well. He leaned closer, examining my forehead as we drove.\\n\\n“Well. That’s not good.”\\n\\n“What do you mean it’s not good?” My voice betrayed the alarm I was feeling, “What’s wrong with me?”\\n\\nIgnatius shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea, but we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nI looked forward and noticed we’d arrived at the clinic. Because wolf-shifters have different healing abilities compared to the average human, each pack has its own clinic with skilled healers to deal with whatever ailments our bodies can’t fix on their own.\\n\\nAilments like an apparently faulty healing ability. I closed my eyes. Today hadn’t turned out at all like I had expected it to. I should have just stayed in bed.\\n\\nIgnatius refused to let me attempt walking by myself. He carried me through the revolving doors and spoke with the receptionist while I sat mute in his arms, scowling at the wall behind us. If he hadn’t been so helpful today I would have berated him for babying me in that moment.\\n\\nA nurse led us to an empty bed and hurried away again to fetch a healer.\\n\\n“You don’t have to stay,” I said, as Ignatius placed me gently on the crisp sheets and settled into a chair next to me, “Thank you for everything you’ve done but I think I can handle things from here.”\\n\\n“I have time to spare,” Ignatius clasped his hands together and leaned his forearms on his knees, “And thinking about it now, we haven’t even been properly acquainted. You’re a friend of Johan’s?”\\n\\nI shook my head, a part of me was relieved to have company. And something about this boy was incredibly compelling to me.\\n\\n“No. Well, not exactly. How do you know Johan?”\\n\\nUttering his name had my stomach twisting painfully and my inner-wolf shied from the melancholy.\\n\\nBefore Ignatius could answer me, the healer stepped in - a short wrinkled woman with tanned skin and dozens of red beads braided into her hair. She adjusted her glasses and frowned when she saw Ignatius in the chair.\\n\\n“You’re not from here boy. You smell of the sea to the North. Don’t tell me you’re responsible for her injuries?”\\n\\n“He’s not,” I interrupted before Ignatius could answer, “He’s been helping me. He’s a - a friend.”\\n\\nI didn’t really know what Ignatius was to me but the fact that he was sticking around meant a lot, although I would never admit it to myself.\\n\\nThe healer narrowed her eyes at Ignatious who raised both his hands in a mock surrender.\\n\\n“Very well. Let’s take a look at you then.”\\n\\nShe tilted my head back to examine the gash, frowning as she did so. “Odd, this should be healing up already. And I’m told your ribs are hurt too…”\\n\\nI sat quietly while she poked and prodded and tutted around me, raising my eyebrow at Ignatius who mouthed back; “Weird old bat.”\\n\\nI stifled a giggle which in turn had me wincing at the pain it caused me.\\n\\n“You.”\\n\\nThe healer pointed a bony finger at Ignatius without turning around.\\n\\n“I will not hesitate to kick you out of here.”\\n\\nIgnatius leaned back in his chair with a smirk.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of inspecting me and berating Ignatius, the healer came to the conclusion that two of my ribs were fractured and I had suffered a mild concussion.\\n\\n“As for your lack of healing abilities,” she glanced over at Ignatious and back to me, “I can think of a few reasons why that could be. We need to have a talk in private.”\\n\\nShe shooed Ignatius out while he promised me he would be waiting right outside. After she finally got him to leave and shut the door in his face, she turned to me, her eyes were serious and her mouth pressed into a thin line.\\n\\n“Dorothy.”\\n\\nShe came to stand before me.\\n\\n“Have you found your mate yet?”\\n\\nHer question caught me by surprise, there was no way she could have known about today. I stammered out a feeble lie in response, asking what she meant by that. She shook her head.\\n\\n“Don’t lie to me. This is about your healing powers. Did you know your powers could be weakened by a rejection from your true mate?”\\n\\n“He hasn’t rejected me!” I protested, louder than I had intended to.\\n\\n“He hasn’t. Not yet…”\\n\\nThe lump in my throat returned and I was on the brink of tears once again. The healer’s eyes softened slightly and she sat down next to me on the bed.\\n\\n“There’s your problem dear. To go on with or without your mate, if the bond between the two of you is not broken or sealed completely, your abilities will never come back.”\\n\\nI sniffed back a sob, rubbing my eyes, “What are you saying?”\\n\\nShe handed me a tissue and waited a moment while I blew into it - angry at myself for being so fragile.\\n\\n“This mate, whoever he is, you have to break the bond officially. If you don’t, things are only going to get worse for the both of you.”\\n\\nI dropped my head into my hands. Whatever “worse” meant I doubted it could top what I was already feeling.\\n\\n“Your stunted healing is only the beginning,” she continued, gently patting my back. “You have to put an end to this now before you go into heat.”\\n\\nHeat? I didn’t bother asking, too caught up in my own sadness to care about what it meant for my future.\\n\\nAfter patching up my forehead somewhat, the healer left me on my own for a while to cry. She told me they had something to help with the pain, but it would only be a temporary fix. I lay curled up on the bed and let the tears fall.\\n\\nI had to break the bond between Johan and me. I had no choice, asking him not to reject me yet was only temporarily avoiding the inevitable. He didn’t want me. There was no avoiding the bitter truth.\\n\\nI heard someone enter the room and peeked out from under my arm. I was expecting the healer but it was Ignatius kneeling at my bedside.\\n\\n“Christ. What did the old bat say to make you cry like this.”\\n\\nHis eyes were sympathetic but I was appalled to be seen in this state. I buried my face in the pillow and gulped back the tears.\\n\\nIgnatius wasn’t having it though and touched my arm gently.\\n\\n“Hey, Dorothy. What did she say?”\\n\\nI couldn’t tell him. Couldn’t find the words to explain the pain that I was feeling.\\n\\nIgnatius hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Does any of this have something to do with Johan? I know it was his girlfriend’s group who attacked you.”\\n\\nI lifted my arm to look at him again. It felt like his blue eyes were boring into my soul. The ceiling fan above us creaked softly as it spun lazily on its axel. I rolled onto my back and stared up at it.\\n\\n“Johan is my mate.”\\n\\nIgnatius was silent for a moment. I kept my eyes on the slowly spinning fan. The rusted wings were caked with dust from years of propelling air laced with debris from the forest outside.\\n\\nWhen he finally spoke, he was perplexed.\\n\\n“Johan… is your mate? Well, I guess that explains his aggression when I put you in my car but why were things so stiff between you two? Does he know you’re his mate?”\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut, balling my hands into fists as I relived the moment.\\n\\n“Then why were you attacked,” Ignatius continued, “and… What about Mavis? Did he end things with her?”\\n\\nI turned my face to look at him and it seemed that my somber expression was enough to put a stop to his questioning. I felt a tear roll from my eye and wrestled to keep my voice steady. It was no use though, It came out like a quiet sigh of defeat.\\n\\n“He didn’t end things with Mavis. And he’s not going to. Because he doesn’t want me as his mate. He made that very clear.”\\n\\nIgnatius’s concerned expression was frozen on his face as I continued, “Mavis’s friends attacked me because they saw us together. They knew I was his mate and that Mavis wouldn’t be happy about it.”\\n\\nI touched the gauze on my forehead.\\n\\n“I asked him not to reject me today. But if we don’t break the bond completely, my abilities will never come back. In fact, things are only going to get worse.”\\n\\nI quoted the healer’s words, my tone flat and lifeless.\\n\\nIgnatius was quiet beside me, his face inches from mine where he knelt by the bed. I gave him a small, empty smile and turned my gaze back up to the fan on the ceiling. It spun around and around above me, creaking softly in the otherwise silent room.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 5\\n~Ignatius~\\n\\nMy brief visit to Johan’s neighborhood hadn’t ended up very brief at all. I had only meant to stop by the college for a few minutes to catch up with my old friend.\\n\\nHowever, the moment I noticed the small crew of girls heading towards a solitary figure on the outskirts of the college campus, I knew something bad was about to go down.\\n\\nSpotting Claudia, Mavis’s top watchdog, amongst them only confirmed my suspicions. Claudia was ruthless and whoever she was after now was not in for a good time.\\n\\nI had already started towards the group when they began their beatdown. Breaking into a run, I could just make out a small figure curled on the ground and a shock of fiery red hair. Dorothy, I would come to learn, was her name.\\n\\nCarrying her in my arms, I found myself enveloped in her scent. The smell of fresh air and gentle rain - floral and enticing. I wasn’t sure why Claudia and her gang had chosen this particular slip of a girl as their newest victim but I was enraged at their brutality all the same.\\n\\nIf I hadn’t had Dorothy in my arms I would have tracked them down and broken more than just a few of their manicured nails. Then again, considering the fragile allyship between their pack and ours, It wouldn’t look very good for the son of the Northern pack leader to launch an attack on a few Southerner girls.\\n\\nGaging from Dorothy’s nonchalant reaction to the ordeal, it was clear that she bore the brunt of their bullying quite often. Often enough to get used to it. And then there was Johan, I had never seen him act so strange as he had, standing there in the parking lot.\\n\\nWe had been fast friends for years. But around this girl, he had been on edge and angry - prepared to fight. We had fought often as children, even as young teens. But this Johan was different, territorial, and on edge.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after that when I learned why. Dorothy was his true mate. Thinking about it afterward, his possessive, primal attitude should have been a clear sign of that fact. He clearly wanted her. And his inner-wolf must have been seething at another man handling his mate. An Alpha at that.\\n\\nI had felt a pang of guilt at my own actions after Dorothy revealed the truth to me. I hadn’t intended to upset my friend or take what his inner-wolf demanded was his.\\n\\nBut with that being said, Dorothy was hurt and in need of assistance, and - in that volatile state - Johan would have been no help in the situation at best and a danger to Dorothy at worst.\\n\\nFurthermore, I was astonished at his rejection of Dorothy, albeit not an official one. I had met Mavis on multiple occasions and while I could admit she was pretty, the venom in her eyes was clear as day to me.\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom rejecting one’s true mate for a woman so potently cruel. My heart ached for Dorothy. I had only known her for a few hours at most but I had been rocked by the urge to protect her from the moment I laid eyes on her brilliant red hair and caught her faint scent on the breeze.\\n\\nTo lose a mate was an indescribable pain. I had felt it myself once. Unlike Dorothy, I hadn’t been rejected, but a stormy night and a fatal car accident had snatched them away from me. There is no pain quite like that of losing what you love the most.\\n\\nThe memory of that affliction was locked away in the furthermost corners of my mind - only to be carefully opened and examined over and over again in the quiet confines of my own bedroom in the dead of night.\\n\\nWhile I couldn’t entirely understand Dorothy’s pain, I could empathize. Watching her tears fall freely as she lay on the bed in that clinic, I fought the overwhelming urge to take her in my arms again.\\n\\nIt hurt to see her so clearly suffering. I wanted nothing more than to fix what was broken and witness a smile - a real smile - as I was sure it would be a beautiful one. Dorothy, however, was not mine to embrace. I was little more than a stranger to her.\\n\\nAll the same, it was difficult to keep my distance and I reached for her small, slender hand. Dorothy refused to look at me for a moment, keeping her eyes trained to the fan on the ceiling and denying my sympathies with a tight-lipped frown. Her fingers, however, closed around mine and she gripped my hand tightly.\\n\\nWe stayed like that for a good long while, comforted by quiet company, before the healer returned with a handful of what looked like powdery sticks and a vile of inky black liquid. Dorothy tried to get up and I propped a hand on her back, easing her into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe gave me a small smile in response and blinked away the tears that had been building on her long, light lashes.\\n\\n“Now then,” the old bat huffed.\\n\\n“Take this three times a day.”\\n\\nShe held the vile to Dorothy’s face.\\n\\nDorothy grimaced at the black liquid sloshing inside the glass, “No more than one teaspoon, or you’ll knock yourself out for hours. And this-” She held up the powdery sticks and snapped them in half under Dorothy’s nose.\\n\\nA shimmer of gray and brown powder burst from the sticks and Dorothy choked and spluttered as she inhaled it, “What - what was that!” she gasped hoarsely, bringing a hand to her chest.\\n\\n“Sugersnap Thyme. Helps with pain.”\\n\\nThe healer waved the sticks around a little more before tucking them away again, “It might make you a little drowsy and disorientated so I suggest you have your young, seaweed-smelling friend take you home.”\\n\\nShe looked pointedly at me over her glasses and I nodded in response, “Yes, Ma’am.”\\n\\n“Uh-Uh,” Dorothy piped up in protest, “not home. I don’t wanna go home.”\\n\\nHer words slurred a little at the end as the old bat’s magic sticks seemed to be taking effect. She lolled forwards and I rushed to catch her, scooping her up and holding her against my chest.\\n\\n“Don’t wanna go home,” she mumbled into my neck and I could hear the stubborn pout in her voice as she said it.\\n\\n“That’s okay, you can stay at my place for a little if you want.”\\n\\nI could see the old bat eyeing me suspiciously, “I’m staying at a villa for the weekend. Right up the road,” I continued as she narrowed her eyes at me. She thought it over for a moment.\\n\\n“Fine,” she eventually relented, handing me the bottle of putrid-looking medicine. “But be sure to let her parents know. Their number should be in the books at the front desk. Everyone in the pack is.”\\n\\nI took the bottle and thanked her for all of her help.\\n\\n“And you be good to that girl,” she continued, “I’ll be checking in later,” I promised to be on my best behavior. Dorothy grumbled out a half-assed thank you and something about a monster in the forest.\\n\\nAfter finding her name scribbled next to multiple home addresses and five different numbers in the big book at the front desk, I carried a very disorientated Dorothy to my car and somehow managed to get her into the passenger seat without bumping her rolling head on the way in.\\n\\nClimbing into the driver’s seat, I heard her say something about a creature in the dark.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nI leaned over to hear her better, buckling her seatbelt at the same time - she wouldn’t feel her ribs aching right now and I didn’t trust her to not topple off the seat entirely on the drive. Instead of answering, she scoffed at me and leaned her head against the window with drooping lids.\\n\\n“Alrighty then.”\\n\\nI spent the drive home calling all five numbers I’d saved on my phone, one at a time. The first three didn’t answer but on the second to last number a gruff-sounding woman told me to try the last number, explaining that she had been Dorothy’s foster mom for a while.\\n\\nShe also mysteriously griped about a pet frog and an expensive cheese platter before hanging up. The final number rang for half a second before someone picked up and I heard a frantic woman’s voice crackle through the phone, “Dorothy?”\\n\\n“Not quite. This is Ignatius Aamodt. Dorothy’s okay, she’s just had a bit of a rough day.”\\n\\n“Ignatius… Elliot’s son?”\\n\\nIt seemed the Southern Pack was well informed about their new allies.\\n\\n“That’s the one. Are you Dorothy’s foster mother?”\\n\\n“Anita, yes. Where is Dorothy? She was supposed to be back by now. Are you her mate -”\\n\\nShe stopped herself, possibly concerned that she’d said too much.\\n\\n“No, I’m not. It would seem… Things didn’t really go to plan for Dorothy.”\\n\\n“Oh. I had hoped… Nevermind. Where is she now?” There was genuine morosity in her voice.\\n\\nShe seemed to truly care for Dorothy and I found myself wondering if Dorothy herself was aware of that. I looked over at Dorothy, who was currently snoozing in her seat. She swatted the air with one feeble hand and then settled back into her dozing.\\n\\n“Currently snoring in my car. We’re heading to the Blue Villa Hotel on Fort Grayvill, I’ll let Dorothy know to call you when she wakes up.”\\n\\nAfter exchanging addresses with Anita and promising to be in contact I hung up and glanced over at Dorothy again. She looked so tiny and fragile curled up there on the seat. Her hair was making a solid attempt to escape the braid it was caught in, cascading down her shoulder and sticking out in little curling wisps of red and gold.\\n\\nHer skin had a pale, almost translucent glow to it and she had the tiniest smattering of freckles over her nose. The tiny opal knotted on a thin string around her neck was the color of her eyes. Eyes that were now scrunched closed like she was fighting monsters in her dreams.\\n\\nMy thoughts wandered back to the nightmare I’d woken her from earlier. The creature in the woods she’d said, or something to that extent. Something about this girl had sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to know more about her.\\n\\nTo get to know her. I wanted to know if she preferred strawberries or orange slices, winter or spring. I wanted to get to know Dorothy, although I wasn’t entirely sure why.\\n\\nI found myself so deep in my musings I almost missed the turnoff to the villa I’d rented out for the duration of my stay. I could have stayed with my father in the fancier hotel further on. But the thought of waking up to Elliot’s cold demeanor every morning was daunting and I was weak in that regard.\\n\\nI pulled the car into the parking area and tried to wake Dorothy up. Her eyelids fluttered and I caught a glimpse of those striking opal irises before she was out once more. Getting out and rounding the car, I unbuckled her and lifted her to my chest again.\\n\\nDorothy wrapped both arms around my neck and sighed into my ear, still half asleep and much less indignant about me carrying her than she would have been if she was awake. Her breath on my neck sent shivers down my spine and her scent was stronger than ever.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun was sending slanted rays of light through the trees nearby and made her hair look even brighter, radiating in the golden glow. Turning to head into the villa I noticed another car parked in the empty bay beside mine. A familiar car. My gaze shot to the entrance of the villa where Johan was leaning against the door with folded arms.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha ”🤩🤩', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔥Read the full version👉Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'KeenNovels', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101464925740704', 'page_likes': 28, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101464925740704', 'ads_count': 14, 'cumulative_ads_count': 14, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:10:07', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Bats and jackals, bears and cats. Vampires, so unnatural in their beauty and strength. But none are more powerful than the wolf shifters. With both instinct and human intelligence, so intertwined with nature and humankind itself, we are more of this earth than you are.\\n\\nI don’t remember much of my mother or pack, but I remember her stories of our kinds’ abilities and the enemies that plague us. Not wholly evil, and not entirely good, those tales haunted my nightmares and dreams alike for years after I was too old for bedtime stories and forgot my mother’s face entirely.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 1\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI awoke that morning with a twisting knot of anxiety in my stomach. I rolled onto my side under the covers and clung to my pillow tightly before heaving in a deep breath and getting up. Today was my eighteenth birthday. Today, I would find my mate.\\n\\nStanding up I examined myself in the mirror, frowning at the spindly pale girl gazing back at me. I wondered if a mate would reject their match based on looks alone. I pulled my hair up into a ponytail before exhaling through my nose and letting it fall loose around my shoulders again.\\n\\nThe bright red locks only made me look paler. I could sense my mate, it seemed they were nearby.\\n\\nIf they didn’t come looking for me there was a good chance I would find them first - their scent almost palatable on my tongue. Already my inner-wolf seemed to crave them, rearing to seek them out. Whoever it was.\\n\\nI could sense something odd about my new mate. While all the desire and enthrallment were present on my side, something about their energy felt off. Things were off to a great start, I thought, tensely pulling at a strand of hair.\\n\\nDespite my nervousness, I couldn’t help the excitement bubbling up inside my chest. I had waited for this day since I had been old enough to understand the mating call. I had wanted this day since I was old enough to want for anything. To be wanted…\\n\\nI was snapped out of my pondering by a quiet knock on my bedroom door. Anita, my current caretaker poked her head in and gave me a small smile.\\n\\n“Today’s the day,” Anita didn’t step into the room - the relationship too short and unfamiliar for affections of any kind, “Are you excited?”\\n\\nI turned back to the mirror and glowered at my reflection.\\n\\n“More like sick to my stomach. What if they don’t like me?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” Anita tutted, brushing the air, “Whoever it is, they’re your mate. And besides, you’re a beautiful girl on top of all that spunk of yours.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile a little. Passed around from foster home to foster home, I had only known Anita for a little over a month at that point, but her kind words eased my quivering nerves slightly.\\n\\nAnita promised to whip up an extra special breakfast - “waffles and hashbrowns!” - before leaving me to get ready for college.\\n\\nAlone and overwhelmed again, I was torn between putting on my best outfits and attempting some kind of make-up endeavor, or treating today like any other day and donning my regular jeans and turtleneck.\\n\\nIn the end, I went for my standard attire with some added rings and necklaces to convey some sort of actual effort.\\n\\nLastly, I swept my fiery hair into a rough braid and pinned the loose wisps back with a collection of different colored clips. After forcing down a bite or two of steaming waffle I assured Anita I would have the rest when I returned and headed out to campus.\\n\\nThe local college was a ten-minute walk from my current home and I spent the entire trip going over introductions in my head.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I’m your mate.”\\n\\nSounded way too formal.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it to campus, I was a quaking bundle of nerves. I wasn’t even entirely sure that my mate went to this college. Although considering it was the only college attended by every young wolf-shifter of the nearby packs, it was highly likely.\\n\\nOn top of that, my inner-wolf grew even more agitated the second I stepped inside. My mate was close, I could smell the hint of pine and englewood in their scent.\\n\\nBefore I had half a chance to look, it was time to head to class. I spent the first hour relentlessly gnawing on the end of my pen and meticulously fiddling with my braid until the whole thing looked like a frazzled mess. All the while running through various introductions to no avail.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I think I’m your mate?”\\n\\nToo timid. I groaned loud enough to startle the dozing boy sitting next to me and plopped my head down onto the desk in defeat.\\n\\nAfter two more hours of barely containing my growing excitement, I was finally free to stalk the campus, following the comforting scent of my soon-to-be mate.\\n\\nI kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the other students who jostled around me in the corridors. I wasn’t particularly popular at this school and people passed me by like I was invisible.\\n\\nThe scent was stronger now, I knew my mate was close. Turning a corner I shivered in anticipation. My legs felt like jelly and my small bites of breakfast were threatening to crawl back up my throat. Then, suddenly, there he was. I knew he was my mate the second I lay eyes on him.\\n\\nHe was leaning against the wall in front of me, flipping through a stack of notes like he didn’t know what else to do with himself. Johan, a gentle Beta of the Kall Pack - it was very likely that he didn’t know of me at all. But I knew him. I was also uncomfortably aware that his girlfriend was the prettiest she-wolf in their pack.\\n\\nI was stunned. I stood there for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the boy in front of me. He hadn’t noticed me yet - but surely he could sense me?\\n\\nJohan ran a hand through his hair - short wavy locks the color of wheat - and continued flipping through pages with a furrowed brow. My courage failing me, I took a small step back.\\n\\nMy inner-wolf raged in response but my mind was suddenly flooded with doubt. Why couldn’t he sense my presence? Maybe he could, but didn’t want to acknowledge me. Surely he would leave his girlfriend now that it was clear that I was his true mate? I took another step back into the shadows of the hallway, preparing to leave.\\n\\nSuddenly, Johan raised his head and looked straight at me. Gentle brown eyes locked with mine and he gave a half-smile that accentuated the dimple in his cheek. Overwhelmed and caught off guard, I turned tail and sprinted back down the way I’d come.\\n\\nIt was all too much. I couldn’t think straight. A million thoughts shot through my mind as I ran, my sneakers squeaking on the laminated floors.\\n\\nJohan was perfect. He was soft and kind and absolutely gorgeous. But he wasn’t mine. Fighting back tears as I made my way to the bathrooms, rushing into a cubicle and slamming the door shut behind me.\\n\\nI pressed my forehead to the cool concrete of the stall and tried to organize my thoughts. Johan was my mate - Johan knew that I was his. He had to. But Johan also had a girlfriend - Mavis - someone who was miles ahead of me in terms of looks, status, and charisma. Mavis who, along with her posse of beautiful airheads, had bullied me since I had joined their pack as a kid.\\n\\nI slid to the floor and put my head on my knees. I thought I would be ready for this day. Today was supposed to be perfect. Today I was supposed to finally belong somewhere.\\n\\nA few treacherous tears escaped and slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away roughly and sniffed. A sudden knock on the cubicle door had me jumping in my skin.\\n\\n“Um, Dorothy?”\\n\\nA quiet voice from the other side, a voice like milk and honey, “Hey, um, Dorothy could you come out here? I promise I won’t bite.”\\n\\nI could hear the grin in Johan’s voice at that last part. His scent, so close and comforting, enveloped me. Hesitantly, I got to my feet, wiping my teary eyes on my sleeve, and opened the door slightly. I peaked out at the boy standing at the door, and he chuckled at my dramatic pouting.\\n\\n“Geez, you run away and frown at me before we’ve even been properly introduced?”\\n\\nHis words were chiding but his tone was light and there was a humorous glimmer in his eye. I swung the door fully open and came to stand in front of him. I stared down at my shoes, hoping he wouldn’t notice my reddened eyes.\\n\\n“I just… didn’t know what to say.”\\n\\nI still didn’t, really. Standing before this beautiful boy, my true mate, all of my confidence went out the window along with my ability to form sentences.\\n\\n“Well, we can start slow,” Johan offered me his hand, “Would you mind if we talk somewhere else? As much as I’d love to hang around the girl’s bathroom I don’t think the ladies will be particularly happy with my being here.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took Johan’s hand and let him guide me out of the bathroom and through the throngs of students towards the small indoor garden.\\n\\nHe sat down on the creaking wooden bench and gestured for me to join him. I plonked down next to him and immediately berated myself mentally for not even trying to be graceful. Johan didn’t seem to mind though and he leaned back on the bench, folding his arms and cocking his chin to gaze at me.\\n\\n“So… my name is Johan-”\\n\\nI couldn’t help a short laugh, cutting him off, and waved my hand to dismiss his introduction.\\n\\n“I know who you are. Everyone here knows who you are. You’re the pack’s golden boy with the bombshell girlfriend and a father on the council. I would have been living under a rock all this time if I didn’t know your name.”\\n\\nJohan smirked and raised an eyebrow at me. “Okay, my reputation precedes me, it would seem.”\\n\\nI breathed a quiet sigh of relief that my interruption didn’t seem to offend him.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Johan continued, “You’re Dorothy right? I’ve seen you around campus a few times,” He laughed at my incredulous expression, “Your hair is a little hard to miss.”\\n\\nI blushed brighter than my locks at that comment and twisted my braid between my fingers. We spoke for a while, I explained that I had been moving between foster homes since I’d been left with the pack as a small child.\\n\\nJohan told me about his father’s strict parenting that landed him with his “golden boy” persona in the first place.\\n\\nAs we talked, I felt myself begin to relax, comfortable in Johan’s calm presence. The excitement I had felt earlier that morning was back and I couldn’t help but smile openly while speaking with my true mate.\\n\\nJohan spoke with a laid-back, boyish attitude and waved his hands around while describing how he and an old friend had once been chased around the woods by a jackal they’d mistaken for a wolf-shifter when they were children.\\n\\nI in turn gave him a dramatic retelling of the story about a pet frog I’d once had and how it had gotten into one of my caretaker’s handbags on their big, fancy date night.\\n\\nAfter a while, Johan’s tone grew more serious and he took my hand in his. I felt prickles of electricity where his skin touched mine and I looked into his chocolate brown eyes in earnest. This was it. He was going to accept me as his mate.\\n\\nI could barely contain my excitement and I could feel my inner-wolf singing in my chest. Johan’s expression, however, was puzzling - almost sympathetic.\\n\\n“Dorothy, you’re beautiful. You’re ‘perfect’. I can feel the connection we have and I know now that you are my true mate. You always have been. But…” he hesitated - wincing like the words hurt to force out, “But I already love someone else - Mavis, her and I… we promised we’d stay together.”\\n\\nIt felt as if a carpet had been pulled from beneath my feet but instead of the ground, there was only open space. I pulled my hand away from Johan even though it pained me to do it.\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\nMy voice cracked slightly, and my eyes pricked with tears once more.\\n\\nJohan’s face contorted as he fought to keep his voice steady, “Dorothy...”\\n\\nI leaned away from him, shaking my head and covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to hear it. I couldn’t. Johan took my face in his hands, using a thumb to wipe a tear that was trailing down my cheek.\\n\\n“Dorothy, I can’t accept you as my mate. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nJohan held onto me as I burst into tears, burying my face in his chest and soaking in his scent while I still could.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 2\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nIt was a long while before my wailing petered out into quiet sobs. I leaned into Johan who had his arms around me, stroking my hair and cradling my shaking frame. I inhaled against his neck and clutched the fabric of his shirt with trembling hands.\\n\\n“Please, don’t reject me yet. Not today.”\\n\\nMy voice was hoarse, a little more than a whisper as I clung to him, “Let me at least have today, even if it’s fake.”\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom a rejection so monumental. Not here, alone on campus where everyone could witness the aftermath. And not today - it was too much to bear.\\n\\nJohan was silent for a moment, rocking me gently as he thought it over.\\n\\n“Alright. Not today.”\\n\\nHe squeezed my shoulders tightly before releasing me and standing up, “I should get going. Again, I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nHe reached out as if to touch my hair, but drew his hand away abruptly, shoving it into his pocket instead. Turning with jerky movements, Johan left the garden and disappeared into the bustling corridor without another word.\\n\\nI stared after him, motionless and empty. My inner-wolf cried in anguish deep inside of my chest. I felt numb, my tears used up, and what little hope I had left was shattered entirely.\\n\\nA part of me wanted to scream and cry for Johan to come back. To beg him to stay. But I was exhausted, and the small voice in the back of my mind was whispering that I shouldn’t have expected anything else. That I would never be wanted. That I would never belong.\\n\\nHeaving myself off the bench, I left the garden on legs that felt like lead. The thought of more classes after what had just happened was unbearable. I slipped out of the college instead and headed towards the woods just outside of campus. Going home wasn’t an option either.\\n\\nAlthough Anita would be understanding, her sympathetic smile would only make me feel worse. In that moment, I just wanted to be alone. I scuffed my sneaker on the tarmac and inhaled the fresh scent of the woods before me. Pine and Engelwood, just like him. I pushed the thought from my mind.\\n\\nBefore I could make it to the woods, however, I heard multiple sets of footsteps catching up behind me and turned to see five of Mavis’s crew heading my way. Why now?\\n\\nI contemplated running, but among the group, I’d spotted Lana, who, with her long slender limbs and athletic abilities had always managed to run me down before.\\n\\nI didn’t see this time going any differently. Instead, I slowed my pace and let them catch up with me, forming a half-circle between their prey and the forest. I folded my arms and prepared to defend myself.\\n\\n“Hello, gingersnap, what has you running out here with your tail between your legs?” Claudia, the speaker in question, donned a malicious fake smile while she blinked at me.\\n\\n“Well hello Claudia, why don’t you mind your own business for once?” I sneered back, “Doesn’t Mavis need her guard dogs today?”\\n\\nI hoped they couldn’t hear the tremble in my voice. Hoped they wouldn’t notice my puffy eyes and tear-streaked face.\\n\\nHatred flashed in Claudia’s eyes and she prodded my chest with one perfectly manicured nail, “I heard somebody found her mate today,” she said in a sing-song voice and poked me again, harder this time.\\n\\nI smacked her hand away. “That’s got nothing to do with any of you.”\\n\\nCladia retracted her clawed hand and coked her head to the side. “Oh, but it does. I heard you were getting quite cozy with Johan over in the gardens earlier. And Alissa said she even saw the two of you leave the bathroom together. Didn’t you Alissa?”\\n\\nShe looked over at the bottle blonde to her left who shrugged and nodded vaguely like the entire conversation disinterested her.\\n\\n“It’s not what you think, he doesn’t even want -” My words came out jumbled and I cut myself off, unable to voice the painful truth.\\n\\nClaudia made no effort to conceal the joy this torment brought her. A cold grin settled across her face. “He doesn’t want you.”\\n\\nWith that, I decided I had had enough. I pushed past the tall girl and made for the canopy of the forest. Claudia clearly wasn’t letting me go that easily though and she gripped my shirt at the shoulder, yanking me backward and sending me to the ground before I could steady myself.\\n\\nClaudia was strong. Inhumanly strong. She was using the strength of her inner-wolf and she was all the more dangerous for it.\\n\\nI landed on my back and immediately tried to scramble to my feet only for Claudia to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach with her pointed boot. I buckled, winded, and collapsed to my knees. I had no time to gasp for air before Lana delivered another kick to my side, and sent me sprawling on the tarmac again.\\n\\nClaudia reached down, grabbing my hair, and yanked my head up to face the girls. “We couldn’t care less about you or who you decide to pine over. But you got a little too close to Mavis’s man and we can’t allow that.”\\n\\nWith that, she slammed my head against the ground causing stars to explode across my vision and blood to pour from both my nose and a nasty new gash in my brow. The girls continued their assault, taunting and jeering while I curled up on my side in an attempt to protect myself.\\n\\nI could barely think straight, my mind was foggy and I cried out at every jab and kick that hit its mark. It felt like they were aiming to kill. I had endured their torment time and time again but this time they weren’t holding back.\\n\\nThe attack went on for what felt like forever when suddenly, through the fog I heard a new voice speak up.\\n\\n“What the fuck is going on here?”\\n\\nA voice so low and dangerous. A voice like ice.\\n\\nThe girls halted their attack and a new scent washed over me - overpowering and intoxicating, it was a musky rose with the echo of a sea breeze. I couldn’t see this new stranger from my fetal position on the ground but I could sense him with every fiber of my being.\\n\\nThe hair on my neck rose and my heart slowed into deep rhythmic beats that reverberated through my entire body.\\n\\n“Who are you supposed to b-” I heard Lana start before she was abruptly cut off by Claudia.\\n\\n“Let’s go. Now.”\\n\\nThere was genuine fear in her voice.\\n\\nI could hear them hurry away, and unfolded myself to catch a glimpse of the stranger who’d saved me. The blood from the wound to my head had dripped down into my eyes and made it difficult to see. I squinted in the direction of the dominating scent and feebly rubbed at my eyes.\\n\\nStanding over me was a boy whose appearance matched the tone of his voice. Cold, and unsettling. His hair was snow white and ruffled like it was caught in a perpetual gust of wind. Dark brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes that were gazing down intently at me.\\n\\n“Who - argh!” I tried to get to my feet but a sharp fiery pain in my side kept me down.\\n\\n“Try not to move too much.” The stranger knelt down and slid a hand between my head and the rough ground, “Looks like they did a number on your ribs.”\\n\\nI winced as he tilted my head slightly to examine the bleeding cut, “Didn’t go easy on your face either,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nI groaned as another sharp pain shot through my side. The bleeding from my nose had slowed but there was no doubt that I looked like a god-awful mess.\\n\\n“Someone should see to that. Do you think you can stand?”\\n\\nThe stranger frowned as I tried to get to my knees and failed miserably, clutching my side and moaning in frustration.\\n\\n“Guess not. Why did those girls have it out for you anyway?” he asked while slinging my arm over his shoulder and lifting me to my feet. He went a step further and swung an arm under my knees, lifting me off the ground and cradling me in his arms.\\n\\nHe took care to be gentle around my aching ribs and headed back towards the college campus. Too tired and injured to be embarrassed, I rested my head against his chest - a chest like warm marble.\\n\\n“They’ve never really needed a reason to do what they do.”\\n\\nI didn’t feel like explaining the truth. I had had enough humiliation for one day without explaining my mate’s rejection to an odd stranger. The answer seemed satisfying enough to him though as he shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n“Typical. Anyway, we need to get you to a doctor. Make sure nothing is broken.”\\n\\n“Hmm.”\\n\\nI was only half-listening, fatigue catching up with me after the events of the day. On top of that, I found I was quite enjoying this boy’s strange scent.\\n\\nAnother wave of pain snapped me out of my trance and I swiveled my head to gaze up at the guy’s face. From this angle, his jawline looked like the edge of a cliff. Everything about him seemed sharp enough to cut.\\n\\n“Who exactly are you?” I asked tentatively. I’d never seen him around before. I was sure I would have remembered a face like that.\\n\\n“Ignatius. I’m from the Allied Pack further North but my father is down here for an Elders meeting. Thought I’d tag along and visit some old friends.”\\n\\nHe glanced down, raising one dark eyebrow at me, “And who are you, little Miss five-on-one?”\\n\\nHis gaze had my stomach twisting in knots and my inner-wolf was stirring in response to this new anomaly. I forced my suddenly gaping mouth closed and looked away.\\n\\n“I’m nobody special.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange name.”\\n\\nHis tone was somehow flat and slightly amused simultaneously. I glowered at his small smirk, wiping my nose where fresh blood was drizzling out.\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy. I’m a part of this area’s pack but not really. And this morning I had waffles and syrup for breakfast.”\\n\\nI turned my nose up and faced away from him again, determined to not share any more of my incredibly mundane current life.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of silent walking and being carried around like a sack of delicate potatoes, I asked, “Do you, like, have a car, or do you plan to walk us to the hospital?”\\n\\nWithout answering, Ignatious rounded the corner with me and fished a set of car keys out of his pocket. Striding up to a flashy, old-school Impala, he unlocked the passenger door and stooped to put me down.\\n\\nBefore he could manage that, however, we were interrupted. A comforting scent, the slightest hint of pine in the air.\\n\\n“Dorothy?”\\n\\nIgnatius turned with me in his arms to face Johan, standing a few feet away.\\n\\n“Dorothy, what happened to you?”\\n\\nGenuine concern in his voice, he seemed as gentle as ever but there was tension in his shoulders and his lips twitched slightly as he eyed Ignatius and his pale arms firmly handling me.\\n\\n“Johan,” Ignatius said nonchalantly, while my head snapped up to look at him so fast I damn near gave myself whiplash, “Long time no see, old friend.”\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 3\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\n“You know each other?” I squeaked, clinging tighter to Ignatius now that Johan’s scent was present and toying with my emotions once again.\\n\\nNeither responded to my question but instead, Johan stepped closer, reaching for me, stiltedly like he couldn’t control his movements. My internal heartbreak still fresh, I cowered away from him into Ignatious’s chest.\\n\\n“I’m okay. Really it’s fine.”\\n\\nI was fighting to keep my tone even but my voice shook slightly.\\n\\n“Um, Ignatious is just helping me out.”\\n\\nIgnatius himself seemed confused by the odd interaction between Johan and me, but thankfully he caught on to the fact that the situation was more than uncomfortable. He proceeded to place me gently in the passenger seat and straightened up to face Johan again.\\n\\n“She was attacked by some students. Gonna take her down to the healer to fix her up.”\\n\\nIgnatius tried to close the passenger door behind him but Johan put a hand out to stop him. He seemed to be wrestling with himself internally, his shoulders shaking and his hands curling to fists.\\n\\n“I should… come with you.”\\n\\nHe spoke with uncertainty, most likely his inner-wolf was fighting for its true mate. He stared down at me huddled on the passenger seat, a possessive glint in his previously soft eyes. I shook my head, silently.\\n\\nThe instinctual part of me wanted him to stay close and I didn’t have the strength to tell him no. I glanced at Ignatious - pleading with my eyes for him to handle the situation swiftly. He gave me a small nod and put a warning hand on Johan’s shoulder.\\n\\n“She’ll be fine, you can visit her later if you need to.”\\n\\nFor a second it looked like Johan would get violent, glancing angrily at the cool hand on his shoulder. Ignatius removed his hand and folded his arms, “Isn’t Mavis going to be wondering where you are?”\\n\\nThis seemed to shake Johan out of his volatile state. He stepped away and allowed Ignatius to close the passenger door. With one final glance in my direction he turned and left, heading back into the college and rubbing an arm over his eyes.\\n\\nIgnatius stared after him for a while before rounding the car and climbing into the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n“Put your seatbelt on.”\\n\\nIt took me a moment or two to realize he was obviously talking to me. I turned my gaze from the window and Johan’s retreating figure to face my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“Uh, potentially fractured rib cage?”\\n\\nI didn’t mean for it to sound quite so condescending but the interaction with Johan and my still aching body had left me in a sour mood. Ignatius started the car and pulled out of the parking bay.\\n\\n“Fair point. Here, for your face.”\\n\\nHe handed me a towel from the back seat and I pressed it to my dripping nose. The rest of the car ride was a silent one, albeit not wholly unpleasant. Ignatius’s scent was as comforting as it was intoxicating.\\n\\nThe salty tint of a sea breeze was detectable even through a nose clogged with blood. He flicked on the radio at some point and I closed my eyes, leaning back in the seat and allowing myself to drift pleasantly into unconsciousness.\\n\\n~Johan~\\n\\nTearing myself from Dorothy had been more difficult than I expected. Walking back into college I made straight for an empty lecture room and slammed the door behind me, harder than I had intended to - the wood splintered slightly and it creaked on its hinges in protest.\\n\\nPlanting my palms on an empty desk I ran through the events of today in my head. I had been able to sense her from the moment I awoke that morning. As much as I had believed I was ready for the mating call, her floral scent was overpowering.\\n\\nWaiting in the hallway earlier while she hesitated to approach me, I felt as if I was standing in an open field. She smelled of fresh air and sprawling pastures, lavender, and light rain. My inner-wolf craved her as I fought to keep my head down, scanning the notes gripped in my fists without actually reading anything.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes from her for long but I was scrambling desperately for the right words to say. I hadn’t expected her to run away, although I couldn’t really blame her.\\n\\nStanding there and pretending that every cell in my body wasn’t singing for her, I couldn’t have given the best first impression.\\n\\nDorothy was perfect though. Talking to her up close - holding her - I could have betrayed Mavis then and there. But we had promised; if Mavis was not my true mate and she wasn’t mine, we would reject our mates and stay together.\\n\\nA duo for years, we had spoken about this day, even as children. When I was nine I crafted her a ring made of twigs and dandelions and swore that one day I would marry her. I loved Mavis, I always would. I couldn’t abandon her for a mate I had only known for half a day.\\n\\nAnd then there was Ignatius. I knew he’d be coming to visit, our fathers had been fast friends for years and Ignatius and I were essentially brothers. Why then would he be hanging around Dorothy? Why would he be holding her? Why was she so eager to go with him?\\n\\nFurthermore, she’d been bleeding. Did he hurt her? How dare he lay a finger on my mate. Friend or no friend I wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart if he so much as -\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with my index finger and thumb. I had let my inner-wolf dictate my emotions. I felt possessive and infuriated at another man near my true mate. But Dorothy wasn’t mine to possess - I had told her so myself.\\n\\nObviously, Ignatius didn’t know about the mating bond, he was just helping out a girl he’d met. And Dorothy had every right to be wary of me, I’d given her nothing but mixed signals and a terrible birthday. I felt torn, tormented. It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult.\\n\\n“So this is where you’ve been hiding.”\\n\\nI hadn’t heard anyone enter, but Mavis was standing behind me with folded arms.\\n\\nShe wore a flowing green sundress and a frown on her face. She waltzed up beside me and hoisted herself onto the desk, swinging her legs beneath her.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you.”\\n\\nI came to stand in front of her and she opened her legs to welcome me. Leaning forwards, I buried my face in her neck and inhaled the scent of her skin and brilliant blonde locks. She smelled of conditioner and expensive fragrance.\\n\\nI didn’t mind the fake floral odor though. I needed reassurance. I needed to remind myself that this was the right decision.\\n\\nMavis ran her fingers through my hair.\\n\\n“So you found her.”\\n\\nHer plump lips brushed my ear.\\n\\n“Your true mate?”\\n\\nI wrapped my arms around her. I wanted to melt into her, assimilate into one being that had no true mate and no mating call to deny. “Yeah. How did you know?”\\n\\nShe blew a raspberry on my neck. I knew she was rolling her eyes without needing to see them.\\n\\n“Allisa obviously. Said she saw you two in the bathroom. And the garden. She said you were holding her.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a moment, waiting for me to deny it. I tightened my embrace and squeezed my eyes shut.\\n\\n“It wasn’t like that. I was honest and she was hurt, I was just trying to be nice.”\\n\\nMavis pulled away and looked me in the eye.\\n\\n“Did you reject her?”\\n\\nIt was hard to keep eye contact. I had never been able to lie to her and this time was no different. I cupped her delicate face in my hand, “Not exactly…”\\n\\nMavis pulled away again and moved to stand up.\\n\\n“Not entirely,” I continued, “But I told her I couldn’t be with her. I love you, Mavis -” I gripped her waist, holding her in place, “I love you.”\\n\\nHer green-gray eyes were piercing and angry, her lips twisted into a sneer, “Then why didn’t you reject her?” she hissed.\\n\\nI straightened up and pressed my palms to my eyes in frustration.\\n\\n“She asked me not to do it today. She was crying, Mavis. What difference does it make if I do it tomorrow instead?”\\n\\nMavis slid off of the desk and stood before me. She pounded a fist on my chest.\\n\\n“You don’t want to reject her, do you? You selfish prick, you can’t ignore the mating call. All of your promises were a bunch of lies.”\\n\\nShe was shorter than me but it felt like she was towering above me, her words like daggers.\\n\\n“Just admit it. You don’t want to ignore it because you’re weak!”\\n\\nI gripped both her wrists in my hand and pressed her fingers to my lips. “I’ll do it, okay? I’ll reject her. You just need to give me some time.”\\n\\nMavis narrowed her eyes and regarded me coldly. She jutted her chin out and yanked her hands away, “I’m the only one who understands you. Not your dad, not your friends, not her. I’m all you’ve got.”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\nI lowered my head, I just wanted it all to be over. This day, this argument, my feelings towards Dorothy. All of it.\\n\\n“I’m the only person who truly cares about you,” Mavis continued, “Who stood by you all these years? Me, I did. I charmed your father, I got along with your useless friends. I got you the status you have today.” She brought her face up to mine and gripped my chin, forcing me to look her in the eye, “Without me you’re nothing.”\\n\\nI knew I shouldn’t let her talk to me like that, but she was right about everything. We needed each other. We had always taken care of each other.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Besides,” Mavis moved her hand to caress my cheek, her eyes softening slightly, “She could never love you like I can.”\\n\\nShe pressed her lips to mine and lassoed her arms around my neck. I leaned into her kiss, convincing myself that if I could just stay close to her, everything would be alright. Mavis pulled me towards her as she backed up against the desk.\\n\\nLost in the moment and determined to push Dorothy out of my mind completely, I hoisted Mavis up onto the desk and she wrapped her slender legs around me. She knotted her fists in my hair and kissed me passionately.\\n\\nI let my hands wander and gripped her thighs under her dress, relishing in the taste of her tongue pushing into my mouth. She pulled at my jeans and moaned for more.\\n\\nWhen I finally pushed into her she sighed into my ear, “Don’t leave me. Promise me you won’t leave me.”\\n\\nI threw my head back in pleasure as she slid her tongue along my neck before kissing her again.\\n\\n“I won’t. I promise.”\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 4\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI was in the woods, standing in a clearing under the silver light of a full moon. I felt safe there at first, bathed in that brilliant glow. I heard something stirring in the darkness of the trees in front of me. Something dangerous.\\n\\nThe slightest hint of a scent was carried to me by the breeze that hushed through the dark and silent forest. The scent of Engelwood and pine. The creature in the dark was approaching. I heard the underbrush rustling as it slowly stalked closer.\\n\\nAll of my senses screamed for me to run, but I was rooted to the spot. I peered into the shadows, trying to catch a glimpse of the unknown being.\\n\\nI glanced down at a sudden sharp movement in my stomach. Something in there wanted to get out. Distracted momentarily by my own body, I looked up again just in time to see the creature with open jaws lurching for my throat.\\n\\nI jerked my body upright as I awoke, inhaling loudly, and looked around wildly for the creature from my dream. Instead, I felt a cool hand on my shoulder and wheeled around, fists swinging, to see Ignatius in the driver’s seat with a look of concern on his face.\\n\\n“You okay? Don’t move so much, you’re still hurt.”\\n\\nIgnatius placed both hands on my shoulders as I continued to shiver, eyes darting all over the place to make sure the creature wasn’t present, “Dorothy? You were dreaming, okay? You’re safe now.”\\n\\nI clung to his forearm, I had to make sure he was real. Ignatius allowed this as I collected my thoughts. After calming down some, I looked around again, “We’re here? How long was I out?”\\n\\nIgnatius removed his hands and sat back in his seat again with an odd look on his face.\\n\\n“Actually we’re just up the road from the clinic. You started thrashing around a little there so I thought I should stop and wake you. Must have been a pretty bad dream?”\\n\\nHe got the car going again and we sped down the street towards the clinic.\\n\\n“Yeah, something like that,” I mumbled, then grimaced as all the pain of my body came rushing back to me at once. Ignatius took my hand and gave it a little squeeze, keeping one steady hand on the wheel.\\n\\n“We’re almost there. This should be a quick fix. And, on top of that, your own healing abilities should be activated by now anyway.”\\n\\nHe had a point. Every wolf-shifter gains enhanced healing abilities around their teenage years, it was the reason no one ever saw the bruises and grazes dealt to me over time - courtesy of Mavis’s posse and Lana’s particularly potent left hook.\\n\\nWhy then was it not working now? The gash in my forehead should have been sealing itself up already but upon close inspection in the rearview mirror, it still remained open and raw.\\n\\nIgnatius seemed to notice as well. He leaned closer, examining my forehead as we drove.\\n\\n“Well. That’s not good.”\\n\\n“What do you mean it’s not good?” My voice betrayed the alarm I was feeling, “What’s wrong with me?”\\n\\nIgnatius shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea, but we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nI looked forward and noticed we’d arrived at the clinic. Because wolf-shifters have different healing abilities compared to the average human, each pack has its own clinic with skilled healers to deal with whatever ailments our bodies can’t fix on their own.\\n\\nAilments like an apparently faulty healing ability. I closed my eyes. Today hadn’t turned out at all like I had expected it to. I should have just stayed in bed.\\n\\nIgnatius refused to let me attempt walking by myself. He carried me through the revolving doors and spoke with the receptionist while I sat mute in his arms, scowling at the wall behind us. If he hadn’t been so helpful today I would have berated him for babying me in that moment.\\n\\nA nurse led us to an empty bed and hurried away again to fetch a healer.\\n\\n“You don’t have to stay,” I said, as Ignatius placed me gently on the crisp sheets and settled into a chair next to me, “Thank you for everything you’ve done but I think I can handle things from here.”\\n\\n“I have time to spare,” Ignatius clasped his hands together and leaned his forearms on his knees, “And thinking about it now, we haven’t even been properly acquainted. You’re a friend of Johan’s?”\\n\\nI shook my head, a part of me was relieved to have company. And something about this boy was incredibly compelling to me.\\n\\n“No. Well, not exactly. How do you know Johan?”\\n\\nUttering his name had my stomach twisting painfully and my inner-wolf shied from the melancholy.\\n\\nBefore Ignatius could answer me, the healer stepped in - a short wrinkled woman with tanned skin and dozens of red beads braided into her hair. She adjusted her glasses and frowned when she saw Ignatius in the chair.\\n\\n“You’re not from here boy. You smell of the sea to the North. Don’t tell me you’re responsible for her injuries?”\\n\\n“He’s not,” I interrupted before Ignatius could answer, “He’s been helping me. He’s a - a friend.”\\n\\nI didn’t really know what Ignatius was to me but the fact that he was sticking around meant a lot, although I would never admit it to myself.\\n\\nThe healer narrowed her eyes at Ignatious who raised both his hands in a mock surrender.\\n\\n“Very well. Let’s take a look at you then.”\\n\\nShe tilted my head back to examine the gash, frowning as she did so. “Odd, this should be healing up already. And I’m told your ribs are hurt too…”\\n\\nI sat quietly while she poked and prodded and tutted around me, raising my eyebrow at Ignatius who mouthed back; “Weird old bat.”\\n\\nI stifled a giggle which in turn had me wincing at the pain it caused me.\\n\\n“You.”\\n\\nThe healer pointed a bony finger at Ignatius without turning around.\\n\\n“I will not hesitate to kick you out of here.”\\n\\nIgnatius leaned back in his chair with a smirk.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of inspecting me and berating Ignatius, the healer came to the conclusion that two of my ribs were fractured and I had suffered a mild concussion.\\n\\n“As for your lack of healing abilities,” she glanced over at Ignatious and back to me, “I can think of a few reasons why that could be. We need to have a talk in private.”\\n\\nShe shooed Ignatius out while he promised me he would be waiting right outside. After she finally got him to leave and shut the door in his face, she turned to me, her eyes were serious and her mouth pressed into a thin line.\\n\\n“Dorothy.”\\n\\nShe came to stand before me.\\n\\n“Have you found your mate yet?”\\n\\nHer question caught me by surprise, there was no way she could have known about today. I stammered out a feeble lie in response, asking what she meant by that. She shook her head.\\n\\n“Don’t lie to me. This is about your healing powers. Did you know your powers could be weakened by a rejection from your true mate?”\\n\\n“He hasn’t rejected me!” I protested, louder than I had intended to.\\n\\n“He hasn’t. Not yet…”\\n\\nThe lump in my throat returned and I was on the brink of tears once again. The healer’s eyes softened slightly and she sat down next to me on the bed.\\n\\n“There’s your problem dear. To go on with or without your mate, if the bond between the two of you is not broken or sealed completely, your abilities will never come back.”\\n\\nI sniffed back a sob, rubbing my eyes, “What are you saying?”\\n\\nShe handed me a tissue and waited a moment while I blew into it - angry at myself for being so fragile.\\n\\n“This mate, whoever he is, you have to break the bond officially. If you don’t, things are only going to get worse for the both of you.”\\n\\nI dropped my head into my hands. Whatever “worse” meant I doubted it could top what I was already feeling.\\n\\n“Your stunted healing is only the beginning,” she continued, gently patting my back. “You have to put an end to this now before you go into heat.”\\n\\nHeat? I didn’t bother asking, too caught up in my own sadness to care about what it meant for my future.\\n\\nAfter patching up my forehead somewhat, the healer left me on my own for a while to cry. She told me they had something to help with the pain, but it would only be a temporary fix. I lay curled up on the bed and let the tears fall.\\n\\nI had to break the bond between Johan and me. I had no choice, asking him not to reject me yet was only temporarily avoiding the inevitable. He didn’t want me. There was no avoiding the bitter truth.\\n\\nI heard someone enter the room and peeked out from under my arm. I was expecting the healer but it was Ignatius kneeling at my bedside.\\n\\n“Christ. What did the old bat say to make you cry like this.”\\n\\nHis eyes were sympathetic but I was appalled to be seen in this state. I buried my face in the pillow and gulped back the tears.\\n\\nIgnatius wasn’t having it though and touched my arm gently.\\n\\n“Hey, Dorothy. What did she say?”\\n\\nI couldn’t tell him. Couldn’t find the words to explain the pain that I was feeling.\\n\\nIgnatius hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Does any of this have something to do with Johan? I know it was his girlfriend’s group who attacked you.”\\n\\nI lifted my arm to look at him again. It felt like his blue eyes were boring into my soul. The ceiling fan above us creaked softly as it spun lazily on its axel. I rolled onto my back and stared up at it.\\n\\n“Johan is my mate.”\\n\\nIgnatius was silent for a moment. I kept my eyes on the slowly spinning fan. The rusted wings were caked with dust from years of propelling air laced with debris from the forest outside.\\n\\nWhen he finally spoke, he was perplexed.\\n\\n“Johan… is your mate? Well, I guess that explains his aggression when I put you in my car but why were things so stiff between you two? Does he know you’re his mate?”\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut, balling my hands into fists as I relived the moment.\\n\\n“Then why were you attacked,” Ignatius continued, “and… What about Mavis? Did he end things with her?”\\n\\nI turned my face to look at him and it seemed that my somber expression was enough to put a stop to his questioning. I felt a tear roll from my eye and wrestled to keep my voice steady. It was no use though, It came out like a quiet sigh of defeat.\\n\\n“He didn’t end things with Mavis. And he’s not going to. Because he doesn’t want me as his mate. He made that very clear.”\\n\\nIgnatius’s concerned expression was frozen on his face as I continued, “Mavis’s friends attacked me because they saw us together. They knew I was his mate and that Mavis wouldn’t be happy about it.”\\n\\nI touched the gauze on my forehead.\\n\\n“I asked him not to reject me today. But if we don’t break the bond completely, my abilities will never come back. In fact, things are only going to get worse.”\\n\\nI quoted the healer’s words, my tone flat and lifeless.\\n\\nIgnatius was quiet beside me, his face inches from mine where he knelt by the bed. I gave him a small, empty smile and turned my gaze back up to the fan on the ceiling. It spun around and around above me, creaking softly in the otherwise silent room.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 5\\n~Ignatius~\\n\\nMy brief visit to Johan’s neighborhood hadn’t ended up very brief at all. I had only meant to stop by the college for a few minutes to catch up with my old friend.\\n\\nHowever, the moment I noticed the small crew of girls heading towards a solitary figure on the outskirts of the college campus, I knew something bad was about to go down.\\n\\nSpotting Claudia, Mavis’s top watchdog, amongst them only confirmed my suspicions. Claudia was ruthless and whoever she was after now was not in for a good time.\\n\\nI had already started towards the group when they began their beatdown. Breaking into a run, I could just make out a small figure curled on the ground and a shock of fiery red hair. Dorothy, I would come to learn, was her name.\\n\\nCarrying her in my arms, I found myself enveloped in her scent. The smell of fresh air and gentle rain - floral and enticing. I wasn’t sure why Claudia and her gang had chosen this particular slip of a girl as their newest victim but I was enraged at their brutality all the same.\\n\\nIf I hadn’t had Dorothy in my arms I would have tracked them down and broken more than just a few of their manicured nails. Then again, considering the fragile allyship between their pack and ours, It wouldn’t look very good for the son of the Northern pack leader to launch an attack on a few Southerner girls.\\n\\nGaging from Dorothy’s nonchalant reaction to the ordeal, it was clear that she bore the brunt of their bullying quite often. Often enough to get used to it. And then there was Johan, I had never seen him act so strange as he had, standing there in the parking lot.\\n\\nWe had been fast friends for years. But around this girl, he had been on edge and angry - prepared to fight. We had fought often as children, even as young teens. But this Johan was different, territorial, and on edge.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after that when I learned why. Dorothy was his true mate. Thinking about it afterward, his possessive, primal attitude should have been a clear sign of that fact. He clearly wanted her. And his inner-wolf must have been seething at another man handling his mate. An Alpha at that.\\n\\nI had felt a pang of guilt at my own actions after Dorothy revealed the truth to me. I hadn’t intended to upset my friend or take what his inner-wolf demanded was his.\\n\\nBut with that being said, Dorothy was hurt and in need of assistance, and - in that volatile state - Johan would have been no help in the situation at best and a danger to Dorothy at worst.\\n\\nFurthermore, I was astonished at his rejection of Dorothy, albeit not an official one. I had met Mavis on multiple occasions and while I could admit she was pretty, the venom in her eyes was clear as day to me.\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom rejecting one’s true mate for a woman so potently cruel. My heart ached for Dorothy. I had only known her for a few hours at most but I had been rocked by the urge to protect her from the moment I laid eyes on her brilliant red hair and caught her faint scent on the breeze.\\n\\nTo lose a mate was an indescribable pain. I had felt it myself once. Unlike Dorothy, I hadn’t been rejected, but a stormy night and a fatal car accident had snatched them away from me. There is no pain quite like that of losing what you love the most.\\n\\nThe memory of that affliction was locked away in the furthermost corners of my mind - only to be carefully opened and examined over and over again in the quiet confines of my own bedroom in the dead of night.\\n\\nWhile I couldn’t entirely understand Dorothy’s pain, I could empathize. Watching her tears fall freely as she lay on the bed in that clinic, I fought the overwhelming urge to take her in my arms again.\\n\\nIt hurt to see her so clearly suffering. I wanted nothing more than to fix what was broken and witness a smile - a real smile - as I was sure it would be a beautiful one. Dorothy, however, was not mine to embrace. I was little more than a stranger to her.\\n\\nAll the same, it was difficult to keep my distance and I reached for her small, slender hand. Dorothy refused to look at me for a moment, keeping her eyes trained to the fan on the ceiling and denying my sympathies with a tight-lipped frown. Her fingers, however, closed around mine and she gripped my hand tightly.\\n\\nWe stayed like that for a good long while, comforted by quiet company, before the healer returned with a handful of what looked like powdery sticks and a vile of inky black liquid. Dorothy tried to get up and I propped a hand on her back, easing her into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe gave me a small smile in response and blinked away the tears that had been building on her long, light lashes.\\n\\n“Now then,” the old bat huffed.\\n\\n“Take this three times a day.”\\n\\nShe held the vile to Dorothy’s face.\\n\\nDorothy grimaced at the black liquid sloshing inside the glass, “No more than one teaspoon, or you’ll knock yourself out for hours. And this-” She held up the powdery sticks and snapped them in half under Dorothy’s nose.\\n\\nA shimmer of gray and brown powder burst from the sticks and Dorothy choked and spluttered as she inhaled it, “What - what was that!” she gasped hoarsely, bringing a hand to her chest.\\n\\n“Sugersnap Thyme. Helps with pain.”\\n\\nThe healer waved the sticks around a little more before tucking them away again, “It might make you a little drowsy and disorientated so I suggest you have your young, seaweed-smelling friend take you home.”\\n\\nShe looked pointedly at me over her glasses and I nodded in response, “Yes, Ma’am.”\\n\\n“Uh-Uh,” Dorothy piped up in protest, “not home. I don’t wanna go home.”\\n\\nHer words slurred a little at the end as the old bat’s magic sticks seemed to be taking effect. She lolled forwards and I rushed to catch her, scooping her up and holding her against my chest.\\n\\n“Don’t wanna go home,” she mumbled into my neck and I could hear the stubborn pout in her voice as she said it.\\n\\n“That’s okay, you can stay at my place for a little if you want.”\\n\\nI could see the old bat eyeing me suspiciously, “I’m staying at a villa for the weekend. Right up the road,” I continued as she narrowed her eyes at me. She thought it over for a moment.\\n\\n“Fine,” she eventually relented, handing me the bottle of putrid-looking medicine. “But be sure to let her parents know. Their number should be in the books at the front desk. Everyone in the pack is.”\\n\\nI took the bottle and thanked her for all of her help.\\n\\n“And you be good to that girl,” she continued, “I’ll be checking in later,” I promised to be on my best behavior. Dorothy grumbled out a half-assed thank you and something about a monster in the forest.\\n\\nAfter finding her name scribbled next to multiple home addresses and five different numbers in the big book at the front desk, I carried a very disorientated Dorothy to my car and somehow managed to get her into the passenger seat without bumping her rolling head on the way in.\\n\\nClimbing into the driver’s seat, I heard her say something about a creature in the dark.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nI leaned over to hear her better, buckling her seatbelt at the same time - she wouldn’t feel her ribs aching right now and I didn’t trust her to not topple off the seat entirely on the drive. Instead of answering, she scoffed at me and leaned her head against the window with drooping lids.\\n\\n“Alrighty then.”\\n\\nI spent the drive home calling all five numbers I’d saved on my phone, one at a time. The first three didn’t answer but on the second to last number a gruff-sounding woman told me to try the last number, explaining that she had been Dorothy’s foster mom for a while.\\n\\nShe also mysteriously griped about a pet frog and an expensive cheese platter before hanging up. The final number rang for half a second before someone picked up and I heard a frantic woman’s voice crackle through the phone, “Dorothy?”\\n\\n“Not quite. This is Ignatius Aamodt. Dorothy’s okay, she’s just had a bit of a rough day.”\\n\\n“Ignatius… Elliot’s son?”\\n\\nIt seemed the Southern Pack was well informed about their new allies.\\n\\n“That’s the one. Are you Dorothy’s foster mother?”\\n\\n“Anita, yes. Where is Dorothy? She was supposed to be back by now. Are you her mate -”\\n\\nShe stopped herself, possibly concerned that she’d said too much.\\n\\n“No, I’m not. It would seem… Things didn’t really go to plan for Dorothy.”\\n\\n“Oh. I had hoped… Nevermind. Where is she now?” There was genuine morosity in her voice.\\n\\nShe seemed to truly care for Dorothy and I found myself wondering if Dorothy herself was aware of that. I looked over at Dorothy, who was currently snoozing in her seat. She swatted the air with one feeble hand and then settled back into her dozing.\\n\\n“Currently snoring in my car. We’re heading to the Blue Villa Hotel on Fort Grayvill, I’ll let Dorothy know to call you when she wakes up.”\\n\\nAfter exchanging addresses with Anita and promising to be in contact I hung up and glanced over at Dorothy again. She looked so tiny and fragile curled up there on the seat. Her hair was making a solid attempt to escape the braid it was caught in, cascading down her shoulder and sticking out in little curling wisps of red and gold.\\n\\nHer skin had a pale, almost translucent glow to it and she had the tiniest smattering of freckles over her nose. The tiny opal knotted on a thin string around her neck was the color of her eyes. Eyes that were now scrunched closed like she was fighting monsters in her dreams.\\n\\nMy thoughts wandered back to the nightmare I’d woken her from earlier. The creature in the woods she’d said, or something to that extent. Something about this girl had sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to know more about her.\\n\\nTo get to know her. I wanted to know if she preferred strawberries or orange slices, winter or spring. I wanted to get to know Dorothy, although I wasn’t entirely sure why.\\n\\nI found myself so deep in my musings I almost missed the turnoff to the villa I’d rented out for the duration of my stay. I could have stayed with my father in the fancier hotel further on. But the thought of waking up to Elliot’s cold demeanor every morning was daunting and I was weak in that regard.\\n\\nI pulled the car into the parking area and tried to wake Dorothy up. Her eyelids fluttered and I caught a glimpse of those striking opal irises before she was out once more. Getting out and rounding the car, I unbuckled her and lifted her to my chest again.\\n\\nDorothy wrapped both arms around my neck and sighed into my ear, still half asleep and much less indignant about me carrying her than she would have been if she was awake. Her breath on my neck sent shivers down my spine and her scent was stronger than ever.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun was sending slanted rays of light through the trees nearby and made her hair look even brighter, radiating in the golden glow. Turning to head into the villa I noticed another car parked in the empty bay beside mine. A familiar car. My gaze shot to the entrance of the villa where Johan was leaning against the door with folded arms.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha ”🤩🤩', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔥Read the full version👉Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'KeenNovels', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101464925740704', 'page_likes': 28, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101464925740704', 'ads_count': 14, 'cumulative_ads_count': 14, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:10:20', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Bats and jackals, bears and cats. Vampires, so unnatural in their beauty and strength. But none are more powerful than the wolf shifters. With both instinct and human intelligence, so intertwined with nature and humankind itself, we are more of this earth than you are.\\n\\nI don’t remember much of my mother or pack, but I remember her stories of our kinds’ abilities and the enemies that plague us. Not wholly evil, and not entirely good, those tales haunted my nightmares and dreams alike for years after I was too old for bedtime stories and forgot my mother’s face entirely.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 1\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI awoke that morning with a twisting knot of anxiety in my stomach. I rolled onto my side under the covers and clung to my pillow tightly before heaving in a deep breath and getting up. Today was my eighteenth birthday. Today, I would find my mate.\\n\\nStanding up I examined myself in the mirror, frowning at the spindly pale girl gazing back at me. I wondered if a mate would reject their match based on looks alone. I pulled my hair up into a ponytail before exhaling through my nose and letting it fall loose around my shoulders again.\\n\\nThe bright red locks only made me look paler. I could sense my mate, it seemed they were nearby.\\n\\nIf they didn’t come looking for me there was a good chance I would find them first - their scent almost palatable on my tongue. Already my inner-wolf seemed to crave them, rearing to seek them out. Whoever it was.\\n\\nI could sense something odd about my new mate. While all the desire and enthrallment were present on my side, something about their energy felt off. Things were off to a great start, I thought, tensely pulling at a strand of hair.\\n\\nDespite my nervousness, I couldn’t help the excitement bubbling up inside my chest. I had waited for this day since I had been old enough to understand the mating call. I had wanted this day since I was old enough to want for anything. To be wanted…\\n\\nI was snapped out of my pondering by a quiet knock on my bedroom door. Anita, my current caretaker poked her head in and gave me a small smile.\\n\\n“Today’s the day,” Anita didn’t step into the room - the relationship too short and unfamiliar for affections of any kind, “Are you excited?”\\n\\nI turned back to the mirror and glowered at my reflection.\\n\\n“More like sick to my stomach. What if they don’t like me?”\\n\\n“Nonsense,” Anita tutted, brushing the air, “Whoever it is, they’re your mate. And besides, you’re a beautiful girl on top of all that spunk of yours.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help but smile a little. Passed around from foster home to foster home, I had only known Anita for a little over a month at that point, but her kind words eased my quivering nerves slightly.\\n\\nAnita promised to whip up an extra special breakfast - “waffles and hashbrowns!” - before leaving me to get ready for college.\\n\\nAlone and overwhelmed again, I was torn between putting on my best outfits and attempting some kind of make-up endeavor, or treating today like any other day and donning my regular jeans and turtleneck.\\n\\nIn the end, I went for my standard attire with some added rings and necklaces to convey some sort of actual effort.\\n\\nLastly, I swept my fiery hair into a rough braid and pinned the loose wisps back with a collection of different colored clips. After forcing down a bite or two of steaming waffle I assured Anita I would have the rest when I returned and headed out to campus.\\n\\nThe local college was a ten-minute walk from my current home and I spent the entire trip going over introductions in my head.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I’m your mate.”\\n\\nSounded way too formal.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it to campus, I was a quaking bundle of nerves. I wasn’t even entirely sure that my mate went to this college. Although considering it was the only college attended by every young wolf-shifter of the nearby packs, it was highly likely.\\n\\nOn top of that, my inner-wolf grew even more agitated the second I stepped inside. My mate was close, I could smell the hint of pine and englewood in their scent.\\n\\nBefore I had half a chance to look, it was time to head to class. I spent the first hour relentlessly gnawing on the end of my pen and meticulously fiddling with my braid until the whole thing looked like a frazzled mess. All the while running through various introductions to no avail.\\n\\n“Hi, I’m Dorothy. I think I’m your mate?”\\n\\nToo timid. I groaned loud enough to startle the dozing boy sitting next to me and plopped my head down onto the desk in defeat.\\n\\nAfter two more hours of barely containing my growing excitement, I was finally free to stalk the campus, following the comforting scent of my soon-to-be mate.\\n\\nI kept my head down, avoiding eye contact with the other students who jostled around me in the corridors. I wasn’t particularly popular at this school and people passed me by like I was invisible.\\n\\nThe scent was stronger now, I knew my mate was close. Turning a corner I shivered in anticipation. My legs felt like jelly and my small bites of breakfast were threatening to crawl back up my throat. Then, suddenly, there he was. I knew he was my mate the second I lay eyes on him.\\n\\nHe was leaning against the wall in front of me, flipping through a stack of notes like he didn’t know what else to do with himself. Johan, a gentle Beta of the Kall Pack - it was very likely that he didn’t know of me at all. But I knew him. I was also uncomfortably aware that his girlfriend was the prettiest she-wolf in their pack.\\n\\nI was stunned. I stood there for a moment, mouth agape, staring at the boy in front of me. He hadn’t noticed me yet - but surely he could sense me?\\n\\nJohan ran a hand through his hair - short wavy locks the color of wheat - and continued flipping through pages with a furrowed brow. My courage failing me, I took a small step back.\\n\\nMy inner-wolf raged in response but my mind was suddenly flooded with doubt. Why couldn’t he sense my presence? Maybe he could, but didn’t want to acknowledge me. Surely he would leave his girlfriend now that it was clear that I was his true mate? I took another step back into the shadows of the hallway, preparing to leave.\\n\\nSuddenly, Johan raised his head and looked straight at me. Gentle brown eyes locked with mine and he gave a half-smile that accentuated the dimple in his cheek. Overwhelmed and caught off guard, I turned tail and sprinted back down the way I’d come.\\n\\nIt was all too much. I couldn’t think straight. A million thoughts shot through my mind as I ran, my sneakers squeaking on the laminated floors.\\n\\nJohan was perfect. He was soft and kind and absolutely gorgeous. But he wasn’t mine. Fighting back tears as I made my way to the bathrooms, rushing into a cubicle and slamming the door shut behind me.\\n\\nI pressed my forehead to the cool concrete of the stall and tried to organize my thoughts. Johan was my mate - Johan knew that I was his. He had to. But Johan also had a girlfriend - Mavis - someone who was miles ahead of me in terms of looks, status, and charisma. Mavis who, along with her posse of beautiful airheads, had bullied me since I had joined their pack as a kid.\\n\\nI slid to the floor and put my head on my knees. I thought I would be ready for this day. Today was supposed to be perfect. Today I was supposed to finally belong somewhere.\\n\\nA few treacherous tears escaped and slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away roughly and sniffed. A sudden knock on the cubicle door had me jumping in my skin.\\n\\n“Um, Dorothy?”\\n\\nA quiet voice from the other side, a voice like milk and honey, “Hey, um, Dorothy could you come out here? I promise I won’t bite.”\\n\\nI could hear the grin in Johan’s voice at that last part. His scent, so close and comforting, enveloped me. Hesitantly, I got to my feet, wiping my teary eyes on my sleeve, and opened the door slightly. I peaked out at the boy standing at the door, and he chuckled at my dramatic pouting.\\n\\n“Geez, you run away and frown at me before we’ve even been properly introduced?”\\n\\nHis words were chiding but his tone was light and there was a humorous glimmer in his eye. I swung the door fully open and came to stand in front of him. I stared down at my shoes, hoping he wouldn’t notice my reddened eyes.\\n\\n“I just… didn’t know what to say.”\\n\\nI still didn’t, really. Standing before this beautiful boy, my true mate, all of my confidence went out the window along with my ability to form sentences.\\n\\n“Well, we can start slow,” Johan offered me his hand, “Would you mind if we talk somewhere else? As much as I’d love to hang around the girl’s bathroom I don’t think the ladies will be particularly happy with my being here.”\\n\\nDumbfounded, I took Johan’s hand and let him guide me out of the bathroom and through the throngs of students towards the small indoor garden.\\n\\nHe sat down on the creaking wooden bench and gestured for me to join him. I plonked down next to him and immediately berated myself mentally for not even trying to be graceful. Johan didn’t seem to mind though and he leaned back on the bench, folding his arms and cocking his chin to gaze at me.\\n\\n“So… my name is Johan-”\\n\\nI couldn’t help a short laugh, cutting him off, and waved my hand to dismiss his introduction.\\n\\n“I know who you are. Everyone here knows who you are. You’re the pack’s golden boy with the bombshell girlfriend and a father on the council. I would have been living under a rock all this time if I didn’t know your name.”\\n\\nJohan smirked and raised an eyebrow at me. “Okay, my reputation precedes me, it would seem.”\\n\\nI breathed a quiet sigh of relief that my interruption didn’t seem to offend him.\\n\\n“Anyway,” Johan continued, “You’re Dorothy right? I’ve seen you around campus a few times,” He laughed at my incredulous expression, “Your hair is a little hard to miss.”\\n\\nI blushed brighter than my locks at that comment and twisted my braid between my fingers. We spoke for a while, I explained that I had been moving between foster homes since I’d been left with the pack as a small child.\\n\\nJohan told me about his father’s strict parenting that landed him with his “golden boy” persona in the first place.\\n\\nAs we talked, I felt myself begin to relax, comfortable in Johan’s calm presence. The excitement I had felt earlier that morning was back and I couldn’t help but smile openly while speaking with my true mate.\\n\\nJohan spoke with a laid-back, boyish attitude and waved his hands around while describing how he and an old friend had once been chased around the woods by a jackal they’d mistaken for a wolf-shifter when they were children.\\n\\nI in turn gave him a dramatic retelling of the story about a pet frog I’d once had and how it had gotten into one of my caretaker’s handbags on their big, fancy date night.\\n\\nAfter a while, Johan’s tone grew more serious and he took my hand in his. I felt prickles of electricity where his skin touched mine and I looked into his chocolate brown eyes in earnest. This was it. He was going to accept me as his mate.\\n\\nI could barely contain my excitement and I could feel my inner-wolf singing in my chest. Johan’s expression, however, was puzzling - almost sympathetic.\\n\\n“Dorothy, you’re beautiful. You’re ‘perfect’. I can feel the connection we have and I know now that you are my true mate. You always have been. But…” he hesitated - wincing like the words hurt to force out, “But I already love someone else - Mavis, her and I… we promised we’d stay together.”\\n\\nIt felt as if a carpet had been pulled from beneath my feet but instead of the ground, there was only open space. I pulled my hand away from Johan even though it pained me to do it.\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\nMy voice cracked slightly, and my eyes pricked with tears once more.\\n\\nJohan’s face contorted as he fought to keep his voice steady, “Dorothy...”\\n\\nI leaned away from him, shaking my head and covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to hear it. I couldn’t. Johan took my face in his hands, using a thumb to wipe a tear that was trailing down my cheek.\\n\\n“Dorothy, I can’t accept you as my mate. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nJohan held onto me as I burst into tears, burying my face in his chest and soaking in his scent while I still could.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 2\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nIt was a long while before my wailing petered out into quiet sobs. I leaned into Johan who had his arms around me, stroking my hair and cradling my shaking frame. I inhaled against his neck and clutched the fabric of his shirt with trembling hands.\\n\\n“Please, don’t reject me yet. Not today.”\\n\\nMy voice was hoarse, a little more than a whisper as I clung to him, “Let me at least have today, even if it’s fake.”\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom a rejection so monumental. Not here, alone on campus where everyone could witness the aftermath. And not today - it was too much to bear.\\n\\nJohan was silent for a moment, rocking me gently as he thought it over.\\n\\n“Alright. Not today.”\\n\\nHe squeezed my shoulders tightly before releasing me and standing up, “I should get going. Again, I’m so sorry.”\\n\\nHe reached out as if to touch my hair, but drew his hand away abruptly, shoving it into his pocket instead. Turning with jerky movements, Johan left the garden and disappeared into the bustling corridor without another word.\\n\\nI stared after him, motionless and empty. My inner-wolf cried in anguish deep inside of my chest. I felt numb, my tears used up, and what little hope I had left was shattered entirely.\\n\\nA part of me wanted to scream and cry for Johan to come back. To beg him to stay. But I was exhausted, and the small voice in the back of my mind was whispering that I shouldn’t have expected anything else. That I would never be wanted. That I would never belong.\\n\\nHeaving myself off the bench, I left the garden on legs that felt like lead. The thought of more classes after what had just happened was unbearable. I slipped out of the college instead and headed towards the woods just outside of campus. Going home wasn’t an option either.\\n\\nAlthough Anita would be understanding, her sympathetic smile would only make me feel worse. In that moment, I just wanted to be alone. I scuffed my sneaker on the tarmac and inhaled the fresh scent of the woods before me. Pine and Engelwood, just like him. I pushed the thought from my mind.\\n\\nBefore I could make it to the woods, however, I heard multiple sets of footsteps catching up behind me and turned to see five of Mavis’s crew heading my way. Why now?\\n\\nI contemplated running, but among the group, I’d spotted Lana, who, with her long slender limbs and athletic abilities had always managed to run me down before.\\n\\nI didn’t see this time going any differently. Instead, I slowed my pace and let them catch up with me, forming a half-circle between their prey and the forest. I folded my arms and prepared to defend myself.\\n\\n“Hello, gingersnap, what has you running out here with your tail between your legs?” Claudia, the speaker in question, donned a malicious fake smile while she blinked at me.\\n\\n“Well hello Claudia, why don’t you mind your own business for once?” I sneered back, “Doesn’t Mavis need her guard dogs today?”\\n\\nI hoped they couldn’t hear the tremble in my voice. Hoped they wouldn’t notice my puffy eyes and tear-streaked face.\\n\\nHatred flashed in Claudia’s eyes and she prodded my chest with one perfectly manicured nail, “I heard somebody found her mate today,” she said in a sing-song voice and poked me again, harder this time.\\n\\nI smacked her hand away. “That’s got nothing to do with any of you.”\\n\\nCladia retracted her clawed hand and coked her head to the side. “Oh, but it does. I heard you were getting quite cozy with Johan over in the gardens earlier. And Alissa said she even saw the two of you leave the bathroom together. Didn’t you Alissa?”\\n\\nShe looked over at the bottle blonde to her left who shrugged and nodded vaguely like the entire conversation disinterested her.\\n\\n“It’s not what you think, he doesn’t even want -” My words came out jumbled and I cut myself off, unable to voice the painful truth.\\n\\nClaudia made no effort to conceal the joy this torment brought her. A cold grin settled across her face. “He doesn’t want you.”\\n\\nWith that, I decided I had had enough. I pushed past the tall girl and made for the canopy of the forest. Claudia clearly wasn’t letting me go that easily though and she gripped my shirt at the shoulder, yanking me backward and sending me to the ground before I could steady myself.\\n\\nClaudia was strong. Inhumanly strong. She was using the strength of her inner-wolf and she was all the more dangerous for it.\\n\\nI landed on my back and immediately tried to scramble to my feet only for Claudia to deliver a sharp kick to my stomach with her pointed boot. I buckled, winded, and collapsed to my knees. I had no time to gasp for air before Lana delivered another kick to my side, and sent me sprawling on the tarmac again.\\n\\nClaudia reached down, grabbing my hair, and yanked my head up to face the girls. “We couldn’t care less about you or who you decide to pine over. But you got a little too close to Mavis’s man and we can’t allow that.”\\n\\nWith that, she slammed my head against the ground causing stars to explode across my vision and blood to pour from both my nose and a nasty new gash in my brow. The girls continued their assault, taunting and jeering while I curled up on my side in an attempt to protect myself.\\n\\nI could barely think straight, my mind was foggy and I cried out at every jab and kick that hit its mark. It felt like they were aiming to kill. I had endured their torment time and time again but this time they weren’t holding back.\\n\\nThe attack went on for what felt like forever when suddenly, through the fog I heard a new voice speak up.\\n\\n“What the fuck is going on here?”\\n\\nA voice so low and dangerous. A voice like ice.\\n\\nThe girls halted their attack and a new scent washed over me - overpowering and intoxicating, it was a musky rose with the echo of a sea breeze. I couldn’t see this new stranger from my fetal position on the ground but I could sense him with every fiber of my being.\\n\\nThe hair on my neck rose and my heart slowed into deep rhythmic beats that reverberated through my entire body.\\n\\n“Who are you supposed to b-” I heard Lana start before she was abruptly cut off by Claudia.\\n\\n“Let’s go. Now.”\\n\\nThere was genuine fear in her voice.\\n\\nI could hear them hurry away, and unfolded myself to catch a glimpse of the stranger who’d saved me. The blood from the wound to my head had dripped down into my eyes and made it difficult to see. I squinted in the direction of the dominating scent and feebly rubbed at my eyes.\\n\\nStanding over me was a boy whose appearance matched the tone of his voice. Cold, and unsettling. His hair was snow white and ruffled like it was caught in a perpetual gust of wind. Dark brows furrowed over piercing blue eyes that were gazing down intently at me.\\n\\n“Who - argh!” I tried to get to my feet but a sharp fiery pain in my side kept me down.\\n\\n“Try not to move too much.” The stranger knelt down and slid a hand between my head and the rough ground, “Looks like they did a number on your ribs.”\\n\\nI winced as he tilted my head slightly to examine the bleeding cut, “Didn’t go easy on your face either,” he remarked dryly.\\n\\nI groaned as another sharp pain shot through my side. The bleeding from my nose had slowed but there was no doubt that I looked like a god-awful mess.\\n\\n“Someone should see to that. Do you think you can stand?”\\n\\nThe stranger frowned as I tried to get to my knees and failed miserably, clutching my side and moaning in frustration.\\n\\n“Guess not. Why did those girls have it out for you anyway?” he asked while slinging my arm over his shoulder and lifting me to my feet. He went a step further and swung an arm under my knees, lifting me off the ground and cradling me in his arms.\\n\\nHe took care to be gentle around my aching ribs and headed back towards the college campus. Too tired and injured to be embarrassed, I rested my head against his chest - a chest like warm marble.\\n\\n“They’ve never really needed a reason to do what they do.”\\n\\nI didn’t feel like explaining the truth. I had had enough humiliation for one day without explaining my mate’s rejection to an odd stranger. The answer seemed satisfying enough to him though as he shook his head in disgust.\\n\\n“Typical. Anyway, we need to get you to a doctor. Make sure nothing is broken.”\\n\\n“Hmm.”\\n\\nI was only half-listening, fatigue catching up with me after the events of the day. On top of that, I found I was quite enjoying this boy’s strange scent.\\n\\nAnother wave of pain snapped me out of my trance and I swiveled my head to gaze up at the guy’s face. From this angle, his jawline looked like the edge of a cliff. Everything about him seemed sharp enough to cut.\\n\\n“Who exactly are you?” I asked tentatively. I’d never seen him around before. I was sure I would have remembered a face like that.\\n\\n“Ignatius. I’m from the Allied Pack further North but my father is down here for an Elders meeting. Thought I’d tag along and visit some old friends.”\\n\\nHe glanced down, raising one dark eyebrow at me, “And who are you, little Miss five-on-one?”\\n\\nHis gaze had my stomach twisting in knots and my inner-wolf was stirring in response to this new anomaly. I forced my suddenly gaping mouth closed and looked away.\\n\\n“I’m nobody special.”\\n\\n“That’s a strange name.”\\n\\nHis tone was somehow flat and slightly amused simultaneously. I glowered at his small smirk, wiping my nose where fresh blood was drizzling out.\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy. I’m a part of this area’s pack but not really. And this morning I had waffles and syrup for breakfast.”\\n\\nI turned my nose up and faced away from him again, determined to not share any more of my incredibly mundane current life.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of silent walking and being carried around like a sack of delicate potatoes, I asked, “Do you, like, have a car, or do you plan to walk us to the hospital?”\\n\\nWithout answering, Ignatious rounded the corner with me and fished a set of car keys out of his pocket. Striding up to a flashy, old-school Impala, he unlocked the passenger door and stooped to put me down.\\n\\nBefore he could manage that, however, we were interrupted. A comforting scent, the slightest hint of pine in the air.\\n\\n“Dorothy?”\\n\\nIgnatius turned with me in his arms to face Johan, standing a few feet away.\\n\\n“Dorothy, what happened to you?”\\n\\nGenuine concern in his voice, he seemed as gentle as ever but there was tension in his shoulders and his lips twitched slightly as he eyed Ignatius and his pale arms firmly handling me.\\n\\n“Johan,” Ignatius said nonchalantly, while my head snapped up to look at him so fast I damn near gave myself whiplash, “Long time no see, old friend.”\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 3\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\n“You know each other?” I squeaked, clinging tighter to Ignatius now that Johan’s scent was present and toying with my emotions once again.\\n\\nNeither responded to my question but instead, Johan stepped closer, reaching for me, stiltedly like he couldn’t control his movements. My internal heartbreak still fresh, I cowered away from him into Ignatious’s chest.\\n\\n“I’m okay. Really it’s fine.”\\n\\nI was fighting to keep my tone even but my voice shook slightly.\\n\\n“Um, Ignatious is just helping me out.”\\n\\nIgnatius himself seemed confused by the odd interaction between Johan and me, but thankfully he caught on to the fact that the situation was more than uncomfortable. He proceeded to place me gently in the passenger seat and straightened up to face Johan again.\\n\\n“She was attacked by some students. Gonna take her down to the healer to fix her up.”\\n\\nIgnatius tried to close the passenger door behind him but Johan put a hand out to stop him. He seemed to be wrestling with himself internally, his shoulders shaking and his hands curling to fists.\\n\\n“I should… come with you.”\\n\\nHe spoke with uncertainty, most likely his inner-wolf was fighting for its true mate. He stared down at me huddled on the passenger seat, a possessive glint in his previously soft eyes. I shook my head, silently.\\n\\nThe instinctual part of me wanted him to stay close and I didn’t have the strength to tell him no. I glanced at Ignatious - pleading with my eyes for him to handle the situation swiftly. He gave me a small nod and put a warning hand on Johan’s shoulder.\\n\\n“She’ll be fine, you can visit her later if you need to.”\\n\\nFor a second it looked like Johan would get violent, glancing angrily at the cool hand on his shoulder. Ignatius removed his hand and folded his arms, “Isn’t Mavis going to be wondering where you are?”\\n\\nThis seemed to shake Johan out of his volatile state. He stepped away and allowed Ignatius to close the passenger door. With one final glance in my direction he turned and left, heading back into the college and rubbing an arm over his eyes.\\n\\nIgnatius stared after him for a while before rounding the car and climbing into the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n“Put your seatbelt on.”\\n\\nIt took me a moment or two to realize he was obviously talking to me. I turned my gaze from the window and Johan’s retreating figure to face my new acquaintance.\\n\\n“Uh, potentially fractured rib cage?”\\n\\nI didn’t mean for it to sound quite so condescending but the interaction with Johan and my still aching body had left me in a sour mood. Ignatius started the car and pulled out of the parking bay.\\n\\n“Fair point. Here, for your face.”\\n\\nHe handed me a towel from the back seat and I pressed it to my dripping nose. The rest of the car ride was a silent one, albeit not wholly unpleasant. Ignatius’s scent was as comforting as it was intoxicating.\\n\\nThe salty tint of a sea breeze was detectable even through a nose clogged with blood. He flicked on the radio at some point and I closed my eyes, leaning back in the seat and allowing myself to drift pleasantly into unconsciousness.\\n\\n~Johan~\\n\\nTearing myself from Dorothy had been more difficult than I expected. Walking back into college I made straight for an empty lecture room and slammed the door behind me, harder than I had intended to - the wood splintered slightly and it creaked on its hinges in protest.\\n\\nPlanting my palms on an empty desk I ran through the events of today in my head. I had been able to sense her from the moment I awoke that morning. As much as I had believed I was ready for the mating call, her floral scent was overpowering.\\n\\nWaiting in the hallway earlier while she hesitated to approach me, I felt as if I was standing in an open field. She smelled of fresh air and sprawling pastures, lavender, and light rain. My inner-wolf craved her as I fought to keep my head down, scanning the notes gripped in my fists without actually reading anything.\\n\\nI couldn’t keep my eyes from her for long but I was scrambling desperately for the right words to say. I hadn’t expected her to run away, although I couldn’t really blame her.\\n\\nStanding there and pretending that every cell in my body wasn’t singing for her, I couldn’t have given the best first impression.\\n\\nDorothy was perfect though. Talking to her up close - holding her - I could have betrayed Mavis then and there. But we had promised; if Mavis was not my true mate and she wasn’t mine, we would reject our mates and stay together.\\n\\nA duo for years, we had spoken about this day, even as children. When I was nine I crafted her a ring made of twigs and dandelions and swore that one day I would marry her. I loved Mavis, I always would. I couldn’t abandon her for a mate I had only known for half a day.\\n\\nAnd then there was Ignatius. I knew he’d be coming to visit, our fathers had been fast friends for years and Ignatius and I were essentially brothers. Why then would he be hanging around Dorothy? Why would he be holding her? Why was she so eager to go with him?\\n\\nFurthermore, she’d been bleeding. Did he hurt her? How dare he lay a finger on my mate. Friend or no friend I wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart if he so much as -\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes with my index finger and thumb. I had let my inner-wolf dictate my emotions. I felt possessive and infuriated at another man near my true mate. But Dorothy wasn’t mine to possess - I had told her so myself.\\n\\nObviously, Ignatius didn’t know about the mating bond, he was just helping out a girl he’d met. And Dorothy had every right to be wary of me, I’d given her nothing but mixed signals and a terrible birthday. I felt torn, tormented. It wasn’t supposed to be this difficult.\\n\\n“So this is where you’ve been hiding.”\\n\\nI hadn’t heard anyone enter, but Mavis was standing behind me with folded arms.\\n\\nShe wore a flowing green sundress and a frown on her face. She waltzed up beside me and hoisted herself onto the desk, swinging her legs beneath her.\\n\\n“I’ve been looking for you.”\\n\\nI came to stand in front of her and she opened her legs to welcome me. Leaning forwards, I buried my face in her neck and inhaled the scent of her skin and brilliant blonde locks. She smelled of conditioner and expensive fragrance.\\n\\nI didn’t mind the fake floral odor though. I needed reassurance. I needed to remind myself that this was the right decision.\\n\\nMavis ran her fingers through my hair.\\n\\n“So you found her.”\\n\\nHer plump lips brushed my ear.\\n\\n“Your true mate?”\\n\\nI wrapped my arms around her. I wanted to melt into her, assimilate into one being that had no true mate and no mating call to deny. “Yeah. How did you know?”\\n\\nShe blew a raspberry on my neck. I knew she was rolling her eyes without needing to see them.\\n\\n“Allisa obviously. Said she saw you two in the bathroom. And the garden. She said you were holding her.”\\n\\nShe was silent for a moment, waiting for me to deny it. I tightened my embrace and squeezed my eyes shut.\\n\\n“It wasn’t like that. I was honest and she was hurt, I was just trying to be nice.”\\n\\nMavis pulled away and looked me in the eye.\\n\\n“Did you reject her?”\\n\\nIt was hard to keep eye contact. I had never been able to lie to her and this time was no different. I cupped her delicate face in my hand, “Not exactly…”\\n\\nMavis pulled away again and moved to stand up.\\n\\n“Not entirely,” I continued, “But I told her I couldn’t be with her. I love you, Mavis -” I gripped her waist, holding her in place, “I love you.”\\n\\nHer green-gray eyes were piercing and angry, her lips twisted into a sneer, “Then why didn’t you reject her?” she hissed.\\n\\nI straightened up and pressed my palms to my eyes in frustration.\\n\\n“She asked me not to do it today. She was crying, Mavis. What difference does it make if I do it tomorrow instead?”\\n\\nMavis slid off of the desk and stood before me. She pounded a fist on my chest.\\n\\n“You don’t want to reject her, do you? You selfish prick, you can’t ignore the mating call. All of your promises were a bunch of lies.”\\n\\nShe was shorter than me but it felt like she was towering above me, her words like daggers.\\n\\n“Just admit it. You don’t want to ignore it because you’re weak!”\\n\\nI gripped both her wrists in my hand and pressed her fingers to my lips. “I’ll do it, okay? I’ll reject her. You just need to give me some time.”\\n\\nMavis narrowed her eyes and regarded me coldly. She jutted her chin out and yanked her hands away, “I’m the only one who understands you. Not your dad, not your friends, not her. I’m all you’ve got.”\\n\\n“I know that.”\\n\\nI lowered my head, I just wanted it all to be over. This day, this argument, my feelings towards Dorothy. All of it.\\n\\n“I’m the only person who truly cares about you,” Mavis continued, “Who stood by you all these years? Me, I did. I charmed your father, I got along with your useless friends. I got you the status you have today.” She brought her face up to mine and gripped my chin, forcing me to look her in the eye, “Without me you’re nothing.”\\n\\nI knew I shouldn’t let her talk to me like that, but she was right about everything. We needed each other. We had always taken care of each other.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Besides,” Mavis moved her hand to caress my cheek, her eyes softening slightly, “She could never love you like I can.”\\n\\nShe pressed her lips to mine and lassoed her arms around my neck. I leaned into her kiss, convincing myself that if I could just stay close to her, everything would be alright. Mavis pulled me towards her as she backed up against the desk.\\n\\nLost in the moment and determined to push Dorothy out of my mind completely, I hoisted Mavis up onto the desk and she wrapped her slender legs around me. She knotted her fists in my hair and kissed me passionately.\\n\\nI let my hands wander and gripped her thighs under her dress, relishing in the taste of her tongue pushing into my mouth. She pulled at my jeans and moaned for more.\\n\\nWhen I finally pushed into her she sighed into my ear, “Don’t leave me. Promise me you won’t leave me.”\\n\\nI threw my head back in pleasure as she slid her tongue along my neck before kissing her again.\\n\\n“I won’t. I promise.”\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 4\\n~Dorothy~\\n\\nI was in the woods, standing in a clearing under the silver light of a full moon. I felt safe there at first, bathed in that brilliant glow. I heard something stirring in the darkness of the trees in front of me. Something dangerous.\\n\\nThe slightest hint of a scent was carried to me by the breeze that hushed through the dark and silent forest. The scent of Engelwood and pine. The creature in the dark was approaching. I heard the underbrush rustling as it slowly stalked closer.\\n\\nAll of my senses screamed for me to run, but I was rooted to the spot. I peered into the shadows, trying to catch a glimpse of the unknown being.\\n\\nI glanced down at a sudden sharp movement in my stomach. Something in there wanted to get out. Distracted momentarily by my own body, I looked up again just in time to see the creature with open jaws lurching for my throat.\\n\\nI jerked my body upright as I awoke, inhaling loudly, and looked around wildly for the creature from my dream. Instead, I felt a cool hand on my shoulder and wheeled around, fists swinging, to see Ignatius in the driver’s seat with a look of concern on his face.\\n\\n“You okay? Don’t move so much, you’re still hurt.”\\n\\nIgnatius placed both hands on my shoulders as I continued to shiver, eyes darting all over the place to make sure the creature wasn’t present, “Dorothy? You were dreaming, okay? You’re safe now.”\\n\\nI clung to his forearm, I had to make sure he was real. Ignatius allowed this as I collected my thoughts. After calming down some, I looked around again, “We’re here? How long was I out?”\\n\\nIgnatius removed his hands and sat back in his seat again with an odd look on his face.\\n\\n“Actually we’re just up the road from the clinic. You started thrashing around a little there so I thought I should stop and wake you. Must have been a pretty bad dream?”\\n\\nHe got the car going again and we sped down the street towards the clinic.\\n\\n“Yeah, something like that,” I mumbled, then grimaced as all the pain of my body came rushing back to me at once. Ignatius took my hand and gave it a little squeeze, keeping one steady hand on the wheel.\\n\\n“We’re almost there. This should be a quick fix. And, on top of that, your own healing abilities should be activated by now anyway.”\\n\\nHe had a point. Every wolf-shifter gains enhanced healing abilities around their teenage years, it was the reason no one ever saw the bruises and grazes dealt to me over time - courtesy of Mavis’s posse and Lana’s particularly potent left hook.\\n\\nWhy then was it not working now? The gash in my forehead should have been sealing itself up already but upon close inspection in the rearview mirror, it still remained open and raw.\\n\\nIgnatius seemed to notice as well. He leaned closer, examining my forehead as we drove.\\n\\n“Well. That’s not good.”\\n\\n“What do you mean it’s not good?” My voice betrayed the alarm I was feeling, “What’s wrong with me?”\\n\\nIgnatius shrugged his shoulders. “I have no idea, but we’re about to find out.”\\n\\nI looked forward and noticed we’d arrived at the clinic. Because wolf-shifters have different healing abilities compared to the average human, each pack has its own clinic with skilled healers to deal with whatever ailments our bodies can’t fix on their own.\\n\\nAilments like an apparently faulty healing ability. I closed my eyes. Today hadn’t turned out at all like I had expected it to. I should have just stayed in bed.\\n\\nIgnatius refused to let me attempt walking by myself. He carried me through the revolving doors and spoke with the receptionist while I sat mute in his arms, scowling at the wall behind us. If he hadn’t been so helpful today I would have berated him for babying me in that moment.\\n\\nA nurse led us to an empty bed and hurried away again to fetch a healer.\\n\\n“You don’t have to stay,” I said, as Ignatius placed me gently on the crisp sheets and settled into a chair next to me, “Thank you for everything you’ve done but I think I can handle things from here.”\\n\\n“I have time to spare,” Ignatius clasped his hands together and leaned his forearms on his knees, “And thinking about it now, we haven’t even been properly acquainted. You’re a friend of Johan’s?”\\n\\nI shook my head, a part of me was relieved to have company. And something about this boy was incredibly compelling to me.\\n\\n“No. Well, not exactly. How do you know Johan?”\\n\\nUttering his name had my stomach twisting painfully and my inner-wolf shied from the melancholy.\\n\\nBefore Ignatius could answer me, the healer stepped in - a short wrinkled woman with tanned skin and dozens of red beads braided into her hair. She adjusted her glasses and frowned when she saw Ignatius in the chair.\\n\\n“You’re not from here boy. You smell of the sea to the North. Don’t tell me you’re responsible for her injuries?”\\n\\n“He’s not,” I interrupted before Ignatius could answer, “He’s been helping me. He’s a - a friend.”\\n\\nI didn’t really know what Ignatius was to me but the fact that he was sticking around meant a lot, although I would never admit it to myself.\\n\\nThe healer narrowed her eyes at Ignatious who raised both his hands in a mock surrender.\\n\\n“Very well. Let’s take a look at you then.”\\n\\nShe tilted my head back to examine the gash, frowning as she did so. “Odd, this should be healing up already. And I’m told your ribs are hurt too…”\\n\\nI sat quietly while she poked and prodded and tutted around me, raising my eyebrow at Ignatius who mouthed back; “Weird old bat.”\\n\\nI stifled a giggle which in turn had me wincing at the pain it caused me.\\n\\n“You.”\\n\\nThe healer pointed a bony finger at Ignatius without turning around.\\n\\n“I will not hesitate to kick you out of here.”\\n\\nIgnatius leaned back in his chair with a smirk.\\n\\nAfter a few more minutes of inspecting me and berating Ignatius, the healer came to the conclusion that two of my ribs were fractured and I had suffered a mild concussion.\\n\\n“As for your lack of healing abilities,” she glanced over at Ignatious and back to me, “I can think of a few reasons why that could be. We need to have a talk in private.”\\n\\nShe shooed Ignatius out while he promised me he would be waiting right outside. After she finally got him to leave and shut the door in his face, she turned to me, her eyes were serious and her mouth pressed into a thin line.\\n\\n“Dorothy.”\\n\\nShe came to stand before me.\\n\\n“Have you found your mate yet?”\\n\\nHer question caught me by surprise, there was no way she could have known about today. I stammered out a feeble lie in response, asking what she meant by that. She shook her head.\\n\\n“Don’t lie to me. This is about your healing powers. Did you know your powers could be weakened by a rejection from your true mate?”\\n\\n“He hasn’t rejected me!” I protested, louder than I had intended to.\\n\\n“He hasn’t. Not yet…”\\n\\nThe lump in my throat returned and I was on the brink of tears once again. The healer’s eyes softened slightly and she sat down next to me on the bed.\\n\\n“There’s your problem dear. To go on with or without your mate, if the bond between the two of you is not broken or sealed completely, your abilities will never come back.”\\n\\nI sniffed back a sob, rubbing my eyes, “What are you saying?”\\n\\nShe handed me a tissue and waited a moment while I blew into it - angry at myself for being so fragile.\\n\\n“This mate, whoever he is, you have to break the bond officially. If you don’t, things are only going to get worse for the both of you.”\\n\\nI dropped my head into my hands. Whatever “worse” meant I doubted it could top what I was already feeling.\\n\\n“Your stunted healing is only the beginning,” she continued, gently patting my back. “You have to put an end to this now before you go into heat.”\\n\\nHeat? I didn’t bother asking, too caught up in my own sadness to care about what it meant for my future.\\n\\nAfter patching up my forehead somewhat, the healer left me on my own for a while to cry. She told me they had something to help with the pain, but it would only be a temporary fix. I lay curled up on the bed and let the tears fall.\\n\\nI had to break the bond between Johan and me. I had no choice, asking him not to reject me yet was only temporarily avoiding the inevitable. He didn’t want me. There was no avoiding the bitter truth.\\n\\nI heard someone enter the room and peeked out from under my arm. I was expecting the healer but it was Ignatius kneeling at my bedside.\\n\\n“Christ. What did the old bat say to make you cry like this.”\\n\\nHis eyes were sympathetic but I was appalled to be seen in this state. I buried my face in the pillow and gulped back the tears.\\n\\nIgnatius wasn’t having it though and touched my arm gently.\\n\\n“Hey, Dorothy. What did she say?”\\n\\nI couldn’t tell him. Couldn’t find the words to explain the pain that I was feeling.\\n\\nIgnatius hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Does any of this have something to do with Johan? I know it was his girlfriend’s group who attacked you.”\\n\\nI lifted my arm to look at him again. It felt like his blue eyes were boring into my soul. The ceiling fan above us creaked softly as it spun lazily on its axel. I rolled onto my back and stared up at it.\\n\\n“Johan is my mate.”\\n\\nIgnatius was silent for a moment. I kept my eyes on the slowly spinning fan. The rusted wings were caked with dust from years of propelling air laced with debris from the forest outside.\\n\\nWhen he finally spoke, he was perplexed.\\n\\n“Johan… is your mate? Well, I guess that explains his aggression when I put you in my car but why were things so stiff between you two? Does he know you’re his mate?”\\n\\nI squeezed my eyes shut, balling my hands into fists as I relived the moment.\\n\\n“Then why were you attacked,” Ignatius continued, “and… What about Mavis? Did he end things with her?”\\n\\nI turned my face to look at him and it seemed that my somber expression was enough to put a stop to his questioning. I felt a tear roll from my eye and wrestled to keep my voice steady. It was no use though, It came out like a quiet sigh of defeat.\\n\\n“He didn’t end things with Mavis. And he’s not going to. Because he doesn’t want me as his mate. He made that very clear.”\\n\\nIgnatius’s concerned expression was frozen on his face as I continued, “Mavis’s friends attacked me because they saw us together. They knew I was his mate and that Mavis wouldn’t be happy about it.”\\n\\nI touched the gauze on my forehead.\\n\\n“I asked him not to reject me today. But if we don’t break the bond completely, my abilities will never come back. In fact, things are only going to get worse.”\\n\\nI quoted the healer’s words, my tone flat and lifeless.\\n\\nIgnatius was quiet beside me, his face inches from mine where he knelt by the bed. I gave him a small, empty smile and turned my gaze back up to the fan on the ceiling. It spun around and around above me, creaking softly in the otherwise silent room.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nChapter 5\\n~Ignatius~\\n\\nMy brief visit to Johan’s neighborhood hadn’t ended up very brief at all. I had only meant to stop by the college for a few minutes to catch up with my old friend.\\n\\nHowever, the moment I noticed the small crew of girls heading towards a solitary figure on the outskirts of the college campus, I knew something bad was about to go down.\\n\\nSpotting Claudia, Mavis’s top watchdog, amongst them only confirmed my suspicions. Claudia was ruthless and whoever she was after now was not in for a good time.\\n\\nI had already started towards the group when they began their beatdown. Breaking into a run, I could just make out a small figure curled on the ground and a shock of fiery red hair. Dorothy, I would come to learn, was her name.\\n\\nCarrying her in my arms, I found myself enveloped in her scent. The smell of fresh air and gentle rain - floral and enticing. I wasn’t sure why Claudia and her gang had chosen this particular slip of a girl as their newest victim but I was enraged at their brutality all the same.\\n\\nIf I hadn’t had Dorothy in my arms I would have tracked them down and broken more than just a few of their manicured nails. Then again, considering the fragile allyship between their pack and ours, It wouldn’t look very good for the son of the Northern pack leader to launch an attack on a few Southerner girls.\\n\\nGaging from Dorothy’s nonchalant reaction to the ordeal, it was clear that she bore the brunt of their bullying quite often. Often enough to get used to it. And then there was Johan, I had never seen him act so strange as he had, standing there in the parking lot.\\n\\nWe had been fast friends for years. But around this girl, he had been on edge and angry - prepared to fight. We had fought often as children, even as young teens. But this Johan was different, territorial, and on edge.\\n\\nIt wasn’t long after that when I learned why. Dorothy was his true mate. Thinking about it afterward, his possessive, primal attitude should have been a clear sign of that fact. He clearly wanted her. And his inner-wolf must have been seething at another man handling his mate. An Alpha at that.\\n\\nI had felt a pang of guilt at my own actions after Dorothy revealed the truth to me. I hadn’t intended to upset my friend or take what his inner-wolf demanded was his.\\n\\nBut with that being said, Dorothy was hurt and in need of assistance, and - in that volatile state - Johan would have been no help in the situation at best and a danger to Dorothy at worst.\\n\\nFurthermore, I was astonished at his rejection of Dorothy, albeit not an official one. I had met Mavis on multiple occasions and while I could admit she was pretty, the venom in her eyes was clear as day to me.\\n\\nI couldn’t fathom rejecting one’s true mate for a woman so potently cruel. My heart ached for Dorothy. I had only known her for a few hours at most but I had been rocked by the urge to protect her from the moment I laid eyes on her brilliant red hair and caught her faint scent on the breeze.\\n\\nTo lose a mate was an indescribable pain. I had felt it myself once. Unlike Dorothy, I hadn’t been rejected, but a stormy night and a fatal car accident had snatched them away from me. There is no pain quite like that of losing what you love the most.\\n\\nThe memory of that affliction was locked away in the furthermost corners of my mind - only to be carefully opened and examined over and over again in the quiet confines of my own bedroom in the dead of night.\\n\\nWhile I couldn’t entirely understand Dorothy’s pain, I could empathize. Watching her tears fall freely as she lay on the bed in that clinic, I fought the overwhelming urge to take her in my arms again.\\n\\nIt hurt to see her so clearly suffering. I wanted nothing more than to fix what was broken and witness a smile - a real smile - as I was sure it would be a beautiful one. Dorothy, however, was not mine to embrace. I was little more than a stranger to her.\\n\\nAll the same, it was difficult to keep my distance and I reached for her small, slender hand. Dorothy refused to look at me for a moment, keeping her eyes trained to the fan on the ceiling and denying my sympathies with a tight-lipped frown. Her fingers, however, closed around mine and she gripped my hand tightly.\\n\\nWe stayed like that for a good long while, comforted by quiet company, before the healer returned with a handful of what looked like powdery sticks and a vile of inky black liquid. Dorothy tried to get up and I propped a hand on her back, easing her into a sitting position.\\n\\nShe gave me a small smile in response and blinked away the tears that had been building on her long, light lashes.\\n\\n“Now then,” the old bat huffed.\\n\\n“Take this three times a day.”\\n\\nShe held the vile to Dorothy’s face.\\n\\nDorothy grimaced at the black liquid sloshing inside the glass, “No more than one teaspoon, or you’ll knock yourself out for hours. And this-” She held up the powdery sticks and snapped them in half under Dorothy’s nose.\\n\\nA shimmer of gray and brown powder burst from the sticks and Dorothy choked and spluttered as she inhaled it, “What - what was that!” she gasped hoarsely, bringing a hand to her chest.\\n\\n“Sugersnap Thyme. Helps with pain.”\\n\\nThe healer waved the sticks around a little more before tucking them away again, “It might make you a little drowsy and disorientated so I suggest you have your young, seaweed-smelling friend take you home.”\\n\\nShe looked pointedly at me over her glasses and I nodded in response, “Yes, Ma’am.”\\n\\n“Uh-Uh,” Dorothy piped up in protest, “not home. I don’t wanna go home.”\\n\\nHer words slurred a little at the end as the old bat’s magic sticks seemed to be taking effect. She lolled forwards and I rushed to catch her, scooping her up and holding her against my chest.\\n\\n“Don’t wanna go home,” she mumbled into my neck and I could hear the stubborn pout in her voice as she said it.\\n\\n“That’s okay, you can stay at my place for a little if you want.”\\n\\nI could see the old bat eyeing me suspiciously, “I’m staying at a villa for the weekend. Right up the road,” I continued as she narrowed her eyes at me. She thought it over for a moment.\\n\\n“Fine,” she eventually relented, handing me the bottle of putrid-looking medicine. “But be sure to let her parents know. Their number should be in the books at the front desk. Everyone in the pack is.”\\n\\nI took the bottle and thanked her for all of her help.\\n\\n“And you be good to that girl,” she continued, “I’ll be checking in later,” I promised to be on my best behavior. Dorothy grumbled out a half-assed thank you and something about a monster in the forest.\\n\\nAfter finding her name scribbled next to multiple home addresses and five different numbers in the big book at the front desk, I carried a very disorientated Dorothy to my car and somehow managed to get her into the passenger seat without bumping her rolling head on the way in.\\n\\nClimbing into the driver’s seat, I heard her say something about a creature in the dark.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nI leaned over to hear her better, buckling her seatbelt at the same time - she wouldn’t feel her ribs aching right now and I didn’t trust her to not topple off the seat entirely on the drive. Instead of answering, she scoffed at me and leaned her head against the window with drooping lids.\\n\\n“Alrighty then.”\\n\\nI spent the drive home calling all five numbers I’d saved on my phone, one at a time. The first three didn’t answer but on the second to last number a gruff-sounding woman told me to try the last number, explaining that she had been Dorothy’s foster mom for a while.\\n\\nShe also mysteriously griped about a pet frog and an expensive cheese platter before hanging up. The final number rang for half a second before someone picked up and I heard a frantic woman’s voice crackle through the phone, “Dorothy?”\\n\\n“Not quite. This is Ignatius Aamodt. Dorothy’s okay, she’s just had a bit of a rough day.”\\n\\n“Ignatius… Elliot’s son?”\\n\\nIt seemed the Southern Pack was well informed about their new allies.\\n\\n“That’s the one. Are you Dorothy’s foster mother?”\\n\\n“Anita, yes. Where is Dorothy? She was supposed to be back by now. Are you her mate -”\\n\\nShe stopped herself, possibly concerned that she’d said too much.\\n\\n“No, I’m not. It would seem… Things didn’t really go to plan for Dorothy.”\\n\\n“Oh. I had hoped… Nevermind. Where is she now?” There was genuine morosity in her voice.\\n\\nShe seemed to truly care for Dorothy and I found myself wondering if Dorothy herself was aware of that. I looked over at Dorothy, who was currently snoozing in her seat. She swatted the air with one feeble hand and then settled back into her dozing.\\n\\n“Currently snoring in my car. We’re heading to the Blue Villa Hotel on Fort Grayvill, I’ll let Dorothy know to call you when she wakes up.”\\n\\nAfter exchanging addresses with Anita and promising to be in contact I hung up and glanced over at Dorothy again. She looked so tiny and fragile curled up there on the seat. Her hair was making a solid attempt to escape the braid it was caught in, cascading down her shoulder and sticking out in little curling wisps of red and gold.\\n\\nHer skin had a pale, almost translucent glow to it and she had the tiniest smattering of freckles over her nose. The tiny opal knotted on a thin string around her neck was the color of her eyes. Eyes that were now scrunched closed like she was fighting monsters in her dreams.\\n\\nMy thoughts wandered back to the nightmare I’d woken her from earlier. The creature in the woods she’d said, or something to that extent. Something about this girl had sparked my interest and I found myself wanting to know more about her.\\n\\nTo get to know her. I wanted to know if she preferred strawberries or orange slices, winter or spring. I wanted to get to know Dorothy, although I wasn’t entirely sure why.\\n\\nI found myself so deep in my musings I almost missed the turnoff to the villa I’d rented out for the duration of my stay. I could have stayed with my father in the fancier hotel further on. But the thought of waking up to Elliot’s cold demeanor every morning was daunting and I was weak in that regard.\\n\\nI pulled the car into the parking area and tried to wake Dorothy up. Her eyelids fluttered and I caught a glimpse of those striking opal irises before she was out once more. Getting out and rounding the car, I unbuckled her and lifted her to my chest again.\\n\\nDorothy wrapped both arms around my neck and sighed into my ear, still half asleep and much less indignant about me carrying her than she would have been if she was awake. Her breath on my neck sent shivers down my spine and her scent was stronger than ever.\\n\\nThe afternoon sun was sending slanted rays of light through the trees nearby and made her hair look even brighter, radiating in the golden glow. Turning to head into the villa I noticed another car parked in the empty bay beside mine. A familiar car. My gaze shot to the entrance of the villa where Johan was leaning against the door with folded arms.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>> >>>>\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha ”🤩🤩', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔥Read the full version👉Destined for Her Second Chance Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'KeenNovels', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101464925740704', 'page_likes': 28, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101464925740704', 'ads_count': 14, 'cumulative_ads_count': 14, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:10:33', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Tonight was the engagement ceremony of Zayn, the son of Ali Enterprises and Chloe Bishop, the second daughter of Bishop Family!\\n\"Zayn... which room are you in?\" Before the wedding ceremony began, Chloe felt dizzy and then left the banquet hall to pick up the phone.\\n\"8607.\" In the phone, Zayn\\'s voice sounded cold as if he had suppressed his feelings and love for her in the past.\\n\"Kate said you want to give me a surprise before our wedding?\" Chloe\\'s lovely dimples showed up on her blushing face. \"... Are you thinking to make me yours? But for the first time, I\\'d like to keep it until we get married. We\\'ve been waiting for two years already after all.\"\\n\"I\\'m not joking with you. Come up quickly.\"\\nZayn hung up the phone.\\nHe couldn\\'t wait to have her already?\\nChloe blinked her eyes and thought, \"I am only 19, will it be...\"\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter, right? He will soon be my fiance.\" She still loves Zayn very much.\\nChloe staggered along the corridor of the hotel. Her delicate and beautiful little face blushed because of tipsiness. She was wearing a short champagne-coloured Chanel dress, which showed her curvy figure. She was charming and lovely.\\n\"It\\'s strange. I didn\\'t drink much... She patted her forehead and her vision gradually blurred.\\nIn the banquet hall, she didn\\'t intend to drink at all. But just now, Mrs. Bishop insisted that she should have a drink with her guests and some prominent people.\\nWalking into the elevator, Chloe pressed the button for the 6th floor while feeling dizzy, but she did not expect to have accidentally pressed the 8th-floor button.\\nThe 8th floor of the hotel is the floor for the VIPS.\\nOnce leaving the lift, Chloe went straight to the room Zayn said he was in. Yet, she couldn\\'t tell 8 and 6 apart clearly. In front of Room 8807, she knocked...\\n\"Come in.\" A sexy and charming man\\'s voice came from inside.\\nHis voice were strong enough to tempt her.\\nChloe pushed the door open and walked in, laughing in a daze. \"Zayn, when did your voice become so deep? It just like you have a bass put in your voice.\\'\\nThe room was not lit, but one could still vaguely see the luxurious furniture of the house, as well as the king-sized bed. It was a presidential suite.\\nThere was a strong man\\'s perfume scent in the room.\\n\"Zayn...\" she moved forwards while leaning over the wall. Then, she collapsed on the big comfortable bed and asked, \"Where are you?\"\\nShe felt a sudden heat that made her uncomfortable.\\nChloe tugged at her clothes....\\nThe sound of running water came from the bathroom. A while later, a tall figure came out.\\nIn the dim light, the man was wearing a bathrobe. The muscle on the bare chest is vaguely showing with the water drops slipped down from his chest.\\nHe was a breathtakingly handsome man.\\nIn the dark, the man looked at the Chloe with his brown eyes, and his voice was beautiful and magnetic.\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\"Hot...\" Chloe\\'s tender lips were slightly opened. \"I want to take off my clothes...\"\\nAfter the glass of wine that her foster mother gave her, her whole body felt like it was heating up, and now her consciousness was getting more and more unclear.\\nThe man tossed the towel that was used to wipe his hair aside and pulled her arm. \"Get up, you\\'re in the wrong room-\"\\n\"Zayn... I thought you want me...\" Chloe wrapped her arms around the man\\'s neck and chuckled. \"I\\'m here... You have to be responsible for me.\"\\nChloe pulled him down, and he quickly held one arm out to support himself, yet he was still almost on top of her.\\nThe light scent of wine wafted into his nose, along with a sweet taste of a young woman.\\nChloe only felt that she had a person in her arms, and smelled the pure and charming scent of shower gel on him. Suddenly, her throat became a little dry, and her body became hotter and more uncomfortable.\\n\"I\\'m suffering, give it to me...\" Chloe rubbed her face on his body comfortably. The coldness on his chest was easing the heat inside her body.\\nShe happily closed her eyes and prepared to give herself to Zayn before their wedding.\\nThe man almost rested his body on top of her was having a woman clinging on him like a kitten.\\nHe endured it and made a phone call to his secretary. \"There\\'s no need to send the meeting files here. I\\'ll go straight to office tomorrow.\\nIn this dark presidential suite, the man hung up the phone and leaned over on Chloe\\'s soft body \"Woman, that\\'s what you asked for....\" He whispered to her ear. \"Don\\'t regret it.\"\\nThat night, he had her for the entire night.\\nThe next day, the room was full of traces showed the wildness that happened the night before.\\n\"Aye...\"\"\\nChloe frowned, and her small mouth moved a little. Then she went back to sleep.\\nThe CEO of the Emperor, Aman, looked at the woman on the bed. She was sleeping like a child, tightly holding the quilt wrapped around her chest. Her snow-white shoulders and delicate little face were breathtakingly beautiful under the morning sun.\\nAman just came back from abroad yesterday, as with the jetlag problem, he planned to stay at this hotel for a night. He even asked his secretary to bring in some meeting files, but he didn\\'t expect this clumsy woman to walk into his room.\\nHe was a man with strong self-control, but this woman completely ruined that with all that flirting she did. Now he saw her clearly under the daylight, this woman looked surprisingly pure, with shoulder lengthen short curly hair and long eyelashes. She was lovely yet playful.\\nLooking at Chloe on the bed, Aman looked over her bag and found her ID - Chloe Bishop?\\n\"I\\'ll be in the office in half an hour...\" He made a phone call. \"Find out a woman named Chloe Bishop and offer her some money. Don\\'t mention me to her.\"\\nThis was a compensation for spending a night with him. After all, he was very happy with this woman last night.\\nAfter giving instructions to the secretary, Aman lifted Summer up and took out the suit jacket underneath her.\\n.. Zayn.\"\\nChloe mumbled.\\nChloe stopped his movement for a moment. \"Zayn?\"\\nHe looked at Chloe whose eyelashes were flapping slightly, and saw a light red butterfly birthmark on her snow-white skin behind her shoulder.

I asked you out only because I mistook you as Kate..\"\\n\"Zayn, what... what did you say?\" Chloe clenched her fists and said angrily with her hands shaking, \"You and Kate Bishop, you two...\"\\nZayn smiled. \"We\\'ve been together for a long time.\"\\n\"You disgusting couple!\" Three words popped up in her mind.\\n\"Chloe Bishop , except for that beautiful face, you are not even comparable with Kate.\"\\n\"You are so arrogant at home as your foster dad, Finn Bishop loves you so much.

The design was very unique and simple.\\nShe sniffed the platinum tie clip and it had a scent of Armani perfume for men.\\nOutside the hotel, there were already packed with paparazzi who were waiting to take photos of Chloe.\\nAfter She left through the safe passage of the hotel, she made a phone call to Alfred. She sat in a coffee shop while looking at the skyscrapers in the distance.\\nCity was a prosperous international city.\\nOn the electronic screen of the highest international trade building in the city\\'s operating centre, a financial interview of the CEO of the Emperor was playing. It was Aman, the CEO of the top 1 international company in America.\\nThis man had achieved today\\'s business miracle by virtue of his unique vision and frequently caught that Chloe and he had been together in hotels...\"This is another rumor that says that Aman is GAY.\\nThe man in the business meeting was wearing a sharp silver-grey suit, and showing three-quarters of his beautiful face. He was showing half of his body, and his thin lips were slightly raised. He exuded the charm of an indifferent noble that made people fall in love with him.\\nAt the bottom corner of the screen, there was his name: Aman, CEO of Emperor.\\nOn the ther side of the open-air cafe shop, several socialites were also talking about it. \"I heard that Aman went to the United States last month to attend a rich Chamber of Commerce, and today he returned home. He is indeed the most successful entrepreneur. If only I had the chance to meet him, it would be great. It would be difficult for women not to love him...\"\\n\"It\\'s really amazing.\" Chloe looked up at the man with a forced smile and a slight sigh. \".... If I met you before I met Zayn, maybe I would also fall in love with you.\"\\nBut that kind of man was completely different from her. She was just an adopted daughter of the Bishop Family... She was totally different from that eye-catching man.\\nAlfred soon arrived in the driver\\'s car of Bishop Family. He got out of the car and hurried over. \"Miss Chloe, are you alright?\"\\nChloe smiled helplessly. \"I\\'m fine. I\\'m not photographed by the paparazzi.\"\\n\"That\\'s good.\" Alfred breathed a sigh of relief. \"Now all the media in the city are paying attention to the things between you and Zayn. It is said that he is still very popular on SNS. He has a lot of female fans. You may be attacked if you encounter paparazzi.\"\\nSome female fans were terrible. With her cheating on Zayn on their engagement, Zayn\\'s fans probably hated her so much.\\nKnowing that there would be no good news for her, Chloe did not read online news. \"I will be careful, Alfred. I called you out to ask about... what\\'s going on at home now.\"\\nThis cafe was usually open to celebrities and socialites. At this time, there were not many people. No one had paid attention to Chloe.\\n\"Alas.\" Alfred stood there embarrassingly and said, \"Miss Chloe, I\\'m sorry. Master refused to let you go home.\"\\n\"Does dad really want to break off the relationship with me?\" Chloe remembered what Kate said at the press conference and smiled.\\nAlfred was embarrassed. \"Where did you go last night, Miss Chloe?\"\\n\"Zayn asked me to go to him\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"He said it on the phone today.\" Chloe smiled innocently to hide her bleeding heart. \"He loves Kate, and it\\'s not me that he wants to marry. Last night, I left the ceremony just to give him a grand reason to break up with me.\" Alfred was shocked. \"Sure enough, Mr. Ali and Miss Bishop...\"\\n\"They set me up!\"Chloe clenched hands trembled slightly. \"They drugged me and set me up to leave the ceremony banquet.\"\\nChloe Bishop felt that she had been bitten by a dog when she found out that even though she was devoted to Zayn, he and Kate Hadid had planned to let her have an affair at a wedding.\\n\"I drank a glass of wine that Auntie Lily gave me last night, and then my mind was not very clear. I received a phone call from Zayn and left.\" Chloe recalled the situation last night. \"When I woke up today, Zayn said in the press conference that I had an affair before marriage, and Kate said the Bishop Family has taken back my shares.\"\\n\"But didn\\'t you personally sign it and give up the shares to Miss Kate, then transfer them to First Miss?\"\\nChloe sneered. \"That\\'s not true. She told me that the documents from the company had been signed for me when I was unconscious last night!\"\\nKate had actually transferred Chloe\\'s shares to herself? It was really an amazing skill of White Lotus.\\nIn the Bishop Family, Uncle Alfred believed in Chloe. When he heard this, he broke out in a cold sweat. \"... Miss Chloe, why don\\'t you go back to the Bishop Family with me to tell the old master about the situation? It\\'s not a trivial matter.\"\\n\"Is it helpful? Will Dad believe my words?\" Chloe knew that in order to take away her shares, Kate must have planned it with Zayn for a long time.\\nAt this time, a car stopped outside the cafe shop.\\nTwo men in suits got out of the car and glanced at the open cafe nearby. Their eyes were fixed on Chloe-\\n\"Are you Miss Chloe Bishop?\" The two men walked up to Chloe with files in their hands.\\nOne of the men had gold-rimmed glasses and looked like a secretary. He took out a check from the folder. \"My name is John, and I am a secretary. Here is a check for Miss Chloe to accept. As for the reason, our master said that we just need to tell you the number of room 8807 Diamond Hotel last night, and that will be enough.\"\\nRoom 8807? Bella was shocked. Wasn\\'t that the presidential suite she had come out of this morning? Was it the man who had slept with her last night?\\nChloe looked at the check... Did this mean that he had paid her for the night?\\nShe restrained the savage rage in her body and stood up with a sweet smile. \"Please wait a moment.\"\\nChloe was quite familiar with this cafe. She walked to the front desk of the cafe and said, \"Please give me an envelope and a pen.\"\\n\"Okay.\" The receptionist gave her an celebrity themed envelope.\\nShe filled some money into the envelope, tore a leaf of paper from her notebook and wrote.\\n\"You\\'ve been helpful. Here is a tip.\"\\nAfter writing the letter, she walked out with a perfect smile and handed it to John with both hands. \"I\\'ve been waiting for a long time. Please tell your master that I don\\'t need the check. I\\'ll give this to him to make sure that he didn\\'t need to thank me.\"\\nThe secretary and another person gave her a strange look.\\n\"If this is Miss Chloe\\'s order, I will go back and tell our master. I will also deliver this letter on your behalf.\"\\nNo wonder he was a professional senior secretary. He spoke and acted without any hesitation. After watching the car leave, Chloe held her hand and said, \"Hmph, everyone has money.\"\\nAfter using her, he wouldn\\'t come and see her, and now he had asked someone to send money to Chloe. What did he take her for?\\nIf he wanted to sleep around, it was she who had slept with him!\\n\"Second Miss?\" Alfred looked at the car and felt frightened. \"... I think that secretary called John looks familiar. Did anyone?\" you offend Chloe took out the platinum tie with a lion head and looked at it. It was engraved with the letters Aman.\\nAn abbreviation of a name?\\nWhat the hell?\\nChloe sneered. \"Nothing. Let\\'s go.

She was totally different from that eye-catching man.\\nAlfred soon arrived in the driver\\'s car of Bishop Family. He got out of the car and hurried over. \"Miss Chloe, are you alright?\"\\nChloe smiled helplessly. \"I\\'m fine. I\\'m not photographed by the paparazzi.\"\\n\"That\\'s good.\" Alfred breathed a sigh of relief. \"Now all the media in the city are paying attention to the things between you and Zayn. It is said that he is still very popular on SNS. He has a lot of female fans. You may be attacked if you encounter paparazzi.\"\\nSome female fans were terrible. With her cheating on Zayn on their engagement, Zayn\\'s fans probably hated her so much.\\nKnowing that there would be no good news for her, Chloe did not read online news. \"I will be careful, Alfred. I called you out to ask about... what\\'s going on at home now.\"\\nThis cafe was usually open to celebrities and socialites. At this time, there were not many people. No one had paid attention to Chloe.\\n\"Alas.\" Alfred stood there embarrassingly and said, \"Miss Chloe, I\\'m sorry. Master refused to let you go home.\"\\n\"Does dad really want to break off the relationship with me?\" Chloe remembered what Kate said at the press conference and smiled.\\nAlfred was embarrassed. \"Where did you go last night, Miss Chloe?\"\\n\"Zayn asked me to go to him\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"He said it on the phone today.\" Chloe smiled innocently to hide her bleeding heart. \"He loves Kate, and it\\'s not me that he wants to marry. Last night, I left the ceremony just to give him a grand reason to break up with me.\" Alfred was shocked. \"Sure enough, Mr. Ali and Miss Bishop...\"\\n\"They set me up!\"Chloe clenched hands trembled slightly. \"They drugged me and set me up to leave the ceremony banquet.\"\\nChloe Bishop felt that she had been bitten by a dog when she found out that even though she was devoted to Zayn, he and Kate Hadid had planned to let her have an affair at a wedding.\\n\"I drank a glass of wine that Auntie Lily gave me last night, and then my mind was not very clear. I received a phone call from Zayn and left.\" Chloe recalled the situation last night. \"When I woke up today, Zayn said in the press conference that I had an affair before marriage, and Kate said the Bishop Family has taken back my shares.\"\\n\"But didn\\'t you personally sign it and give up the shares to Miss Kate, then transfer them to First Miss?\"\\nChloe sneered. \"That\\'s not true. She told me that the documents from the company had been signed for me when I was unconscious last night!\"\\nKate had actually transferred Chloe\\'s shares to herself? It was really an amazing skill of White Lotus.\\nIn the Bishop Family, Uncle Alfred believed in Chloe. When he heard this, he broke out in a cold sweat. \"... Miss Chloe, why don\\'t you go back to the Bishop Family with me to tell the old master about the situation? It\\'s not a trivial matter.\"\\n\"Is it helpful? Will Dad believe my words?\" Chloe knew that in order to take away her shares, Kate must have planned it with Zayn for a long time.\\nAt this time, a car stopped outside the cafe shop.\\nTwo men in suits got out of the car and glanced at the open cafe nearby. Their eyes were fixed on Chloe-\\n\"Are you Miss Chloe Bishop?\" The two men walked up to Chloe with files in their hands.\\nOne of the men had gold-rimmed glasses and looked like a secretary. He took out a check from the folder. \"My name is John, and I am a secretary. Here is a check for Miss Chloe to accept. As for the reason, our master said that we just need to tell you the number of room 8807 Diamond Hotel last night, and that will be enough.\"\\nRoom 8807? Bella was shocked. Wasn\\'t that the presidential suite she had come out of this morning? Was it the man who had slept with her last night?\\nChloe looked at the check... Did this mean that he had paid her for the night?\\nShe restrained the savage rage in her body and stood up with a sweet smile. \"Please wait a moment.\"\\nChloe was quite familiar with this cafe. She walked to the front desk of the cafe and said, \"Please give me an envelope and a pen.\"\\n\"Okay.\" The receptionist gave her an celebrity themed envelope.\\nShe filled some money into the envelope, tore a leaf of paper from her notebook and wrote.\\n\"You\\'ve been helpful. Here is a tip.\"\\nAfter writing the letter, she walked out with a perfect smile and handed it to John with both hands. \"I\\'ve been waiting for a long time. Please tell your master that I don\\'t need the check. I\\'ll give this to him to make sure that he didn\\'t need to thank me.\"\\nThe secretary and another person gave her a strange look.\\n\"If this is Miss Chloe\\'s order, I will go back and tell our master. I will also deliver this letter on your behalf.\"\\nNo wonder he was a professional senior secretary. He spoke and acted without any hesitation. After watching the car leave, Chloe held her hand and said, \"Hmph, everyone has money.\"\\nAfter using her, he wouldn\\'t come and see her, and now he had asked someone to send money to Chloe. What did he take her for?\\nIf he wanted to sleep around, it was she who had slept with him!\\n\"Second Miss?\" Alfred looked at the car and felt frightened. \"... I think that secretary called John looks familiar. Did anyone?\" you offend Chloe took out the platinum tie with a lion head and looked at it. It was engraved with the letters Aman.\\nAn abbreviation of a name?\\nWhat the hell?\\nChloe sneered. \"Nothing. Let\\'s go. I\\'ll go home.\"\\n\\n👇👇👇 Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here!

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:17:17', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:17:26', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:17:36', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:17:44', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:17:52', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:18:01', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:18:10', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}\n"

Her forehead crashed into the solid, hard wall beside in the process.\\n\\n“You are so freaking useless!”\\n\\nA loud voice filled with resentment boomed inside that room, echoing through the walls and ringing in her ears.\\n\\nThis was not the first time Yara heard someone throw those hurtful words and slapped her face, yet she could do nothing but bite down on her lips hard to prevent her tears from falling down.\\n\\nNobody would be her saving grace. Not even her father. The infamous head healer across the Northern lands.\\n\\nIt felt horrible to be treated this way, but since what Mareta’s words were true, which said she was the black sheep in her family, there was nothing Yara could do, except to suck it up.\\n\\nA muffled cry escaped her lips when Mareta decided to serve another backhand to her right cheek before she left her alone in that store room.\\n\\n“You are useless! No wonder Alpha Lucian doesn’t want you as his mate!” Her words were like daggers that were being stabbed in her chest.\\n\\nThe fact that the Alpha of the Northern lands and the daughter of a head healer, were mates, was supposed to be a joyful news.\\n\\nHowever, the reality said otherwise, only if Yara was as good as her older sister, Lyra and she was not the useless daughter, who was not even able to heal her own wounds, her father would be in tears for having a Luna as his daughter.\\n\\nYet, even for her own mate, she was a disgrace.\\n\\nLucian had not rejected her yet even though they found out a month ago, as the pain would be unbearable to break such a bond, but he didn’t treat her well either…\\n\\nThe Alpha was even bold enough to openly take Lyra on a date a week ago.\\n\\nNo one would criticize him for doing that, in fact, many people supported the couple and pitied him for having Yara as his true mate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, despite the pain of betrayal that ran through the bond that they were supposed to share, Yara felt nothing for the Alpha.\\n\\nHe could date any woman that he wanted for all she cared; Yara only wished no one would bother her again.\\n\\n“What are you still dilly dallying for?!” Someone opened the door of the room where Yara was still crouching on the ground and gave her a deathly glare. “Stop being lazy and help around, since you can’t heal anyone.”\\n\\nYara wiped the blood from the corner of her lips and stood up, she reciprocated the scowl with an expressionless face and dusted off her blue gown.\\n\\nShe couldn’t remember the actual moment she lost their respect as the daughter of the head healer, maybe it was ten years ago, when she was seven years old… when she failed to heal her own wounds for the first time.\\n\\n“The great Alpha king will arrive soon, you need to clean up the room,” the woman named Azura spoke to Yara, while she walked away, knowing the girl was following behind her.\\n\\n“Didn\\'t Mareta assign you to complete that task?” Yara protested. She had been taking care of a lot of things that were not supposed to be her responsibility, just because they forced her to while no one came to stand up for her.\\n\\n“Why?” Azura turned around and stomped her feet to approach Yara. She was about to hit her, but when she saw the wound on the corner of her lips, she stopped herself. At least, she still had some conscience left in her system.\\n\\nAzura didn’t want to be blamed for the wound that she didn’t inflict. After all, Yara was still the daughter of the head healer of this land.\\n\\nThis was quite complicated. They treated her like trash, yet at the same time they knew their boundaries and didn’t want to overstep too much, though some time they walked down that path.\\n\\n“Fine, you can choose to clean the room or treat the injured shifters.” Azura folded her arms haughtily. “You choose.”\\n\\nThat was not even a choice for Yara, since she could do nothing to help the injured people. It was still a mystery why she couldn’t heal a single wound, though she came from a great family of healers.\\n\\n================\\n\\nYara watched from one of the three towers in the castle as the great king arrived with his thousands of warrior shifters.\\n\\nThey made a long line through the entrance with Alpha Lucian and Yara’s father at the end of it, waiting for the king.\\n\\nThere was a unique truth about the king. Since his life was constantly in danger, as there was a lot of bloodbath in order to get to the throne, he always wore a mask. An intricate white mask that would hide half of his face and revealed only his pale blue eyes.\\n\\nOnly a few elite people saw his real face.\\n\\nJust like right now.\\n\\nHe walked in front of the army of the shifters, tall and gallant. Rumor said his beast form was very powerful and could make anyone who saw it tremble in fear.\\n\\n“Even though we can’t see his face, but I am sure as hell, he must be the most handsome man throughout this continent,” Lyra sighed dreamily.\\n\\nYara turned around and found her sister beside her. She was not even aware when she came. “I thought you were dating Lucian.”\\n\\nLyra gave her a dirty look. “If I can have the king, why should I settle for the Alpha? Why? You don’t like me to cheat on your mate?”\\n\\nYara scoffed when she heard that. “You can do whatever you want with him. But, when you spread your legs for him, please tell him to be brave enough to reject me,” she said calmly.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nThe bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nIt was not that Yara couldn’t reject Lucian herself, since there was a tacit understanding between the two of them that they were not going to be together in any way, but it was because Yara didn’t have another place to go if she really rejected him one day.\\n\\nAs awful as this place was, this was the only home that she knew and if she were to reject Lucian, since he was the Alpha, sure enough she needed to fend herself out of the Northern lands. In that case, that would be the death of her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when Lyra heard what her sister said, she glared viciously at her and roared in anger. “Say it again!”\\n\\nHowever, Yara knew that this was as far as she could do to provoke Lyra regarding her relationship with Lucian, thus she chose to turn around and leave her sister, but Lyra was not done with her yet.\\n\\nForcefully, Lyra grabbed Yara’s shoulder and made her turn around to face her.\\n\\n“Are you cursing me now in your mind for having the Alpha’s attention?” A sinister smile adorned her red full lips. “If only you were not useless, do you think Lucian would dump you?”\\n\\nYara took a deep breath. She could swear with her life that what she asked from Lyra was her heart\\'s desire. She was being honest when she said she didn’t care about their relationship, though at the end of her sentence, she sounded a little too harsh.\\n\\nAfter all, it was disgusting to see how Lyra slept with Lucian just a few days after the Alpha announced her as the future Luna.\\n\\nBoth of them thought no one saw it, yet Lucian had intentionally invited Yara to witness that. To hurt her. To take revenge because she, the useless daughter of the healer, ended up as his true mate. He was upset because of that fact.\\n\\nYet, Yara couldn’t wrap her head around the way Lucian\\'s line of thought worked. What kind of reaction did the Alpha expect from Yara?\\n\\nIndeed, it was hurting to see your mate sleep with your own sister, but that was all. It was the mate bond that tied them together.\\n\\n“Forget about that part.” Yara swatted Lyra’s hand away from her shoulder. “Just tell him to reject me and you can bear his mark.”\\n\\n“I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” Lyra roared once again.\\n\\n“Lower your voice, or else there will be someone who sees this side of you.” Lyra always appeared as a gentle, graceful and noble woman from the healer family in front of the outsiders, but little did they know that in private she was nothing like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the street, Yara and Lyra’s father along with the Alpha, received the king of the werewolves warmly. They let the great king walk into the hall with his great beta beside him, while the thousands of warrior shifters that followed him, started their duty to guard the place.\\n\\nThe following few days would be hectic until the king left this place.\\n\\n==============\\n\\nYara was tossing and turning in her sleep, she seemed to have difficulty falling into the land of the dreamers. Her head was spinning. And she simply couldn’t close her eyes long enough to make her sleepy, though her body screamed to her to get some rest after the rough and harsh day.\\n\\nGiving up, finally Yara sat on her bed and stared blankly around her almost empty bedroom. There was nothing inside that could be called valuable for her.\\n\\nHer father wouldn’t give her anything nice except a room for her to stay, since he gave up on her for being someone that he disliked. Someone that couldn’t pass down the family\\'s bloodline.\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh, Yara got out of her bed and put a warm cloak over her body. The night was very cold…\\n\\nYara decided to go to the backyard of the healer tower and take a walk. Maybe she was not tired enough to fall asleep.\\n\\nThe corridor was very quiet during this time and only the guards on duty would be around, patrolling the perimeters. Yet they wouldn’t waste their breath to question Yara, since they knew her very well.\\n\\nYara walked down the hallway and passed the study room of her father, the door of which was slightly ajar, letting the words travel out from inside the room in the form of a whisper.\\n\\nAt first, she didn’t want to eavesdrop on the conversation, but when she heard her father mention the king, her curiosity got the better of her and even before realizing it, she had already stopped walking and stood behind the door, trying to hear her father\\'s conversation with the other healer.\\n\\n“… we can’t heal the king as fast as the king demanded.” The other healer spoke to Yara’s father with a voice that was filled with frustration. “We need more time.”\\n\\nThere was a response from Yara’s father, Julius, but she couldn’t hear it clearly since he stood a little far from the door.\\n\\n“No, it is not a wolfbane.” The healer shook his head. “I have never seen such poisons or scars.”\\n\\nYara bit her lips, she really shouldn’t hear such a conversation. The king was poisoned. That must be top confidential news.\\n\\nHowever, didn\\'t the shifters have a great healing ability? Why did they need to seek help from a healer? It was strange, was the poison very noxious until their healing ability couldn’t deal with it?\\n\\nWhen Yara was in deep thought, someone grabbed her wrist all of a sudden and glared at her.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” Lucian asked Yara.\\n\\nAs annoying as it was, Yara felt the spark between them erupt the moment the Alpha touched her, yet it was truly painful to know that she was not the woman he wanted.\\n\\nLucian’s eyes then glanced at the door behind Yara, and heard the conversation as well. His face turned grim. “Follow me.”\\n\\nWithout anyone noticing, Lyra was watching the whole turn of events.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nOne day, someone will walk into your life and you will see why it never worked out with anyone else.\\n\\n-Unknown-\\n\\n**************\\n\\nLucian pushed Yara into one of the bedrooms nearby and pinned her against the wall.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” Yara hissed when she noticed Lucian’s darkened eyes. She thought the Alpha would scold her for actually eavesdropping on the conversation centering on the king’s health, but at this point, Yara was not sure that was what this man wanted anymore.\\n\\nYara could see lust clearly flashing in his eyes as he stared at her.\\n\\n“Why don’t you become slightly useful, so I don’t need to be ashamed to have you as my mate,” Lucian spoke with his low and harsh voice.\\n\\nHe could no longer bear to be away from Yara or ignore her. He wanted so badly to sink his fangs on her delicate skin and adorn it with his mark.\\n\\nBut, every time as well, he would be reminded of how shameful it was to have her for a mate. This drove him crazy with longing and hating himself for not being able to control himself.\\n\\n“You don’t have to.” The words came out from Yara’s lips as a vicious hiss. “You can have my beautiful and bright sister.” And Yara’s next words made the Alpha growl as a warning. “Reject me. That’s all you need to do now.”\\n\\n“Do you really think I will reject you?” Lucian pressed his body against Yara’s, and he hissed when the spark erupted between them. This was something that he couldn’t get from Lyra or any other women for that matter. That was why he was yet to reject her when he could get what he wanted behind the closed doors.\\n\\n“Why?” Yara glared at him, her anger helped her to straighten her mind despite the crazy spark that was now running over her skin and the way how close she was to her mate. She fought the urge to show her neck, a sign of submissiveness, surrendering herself to him.\\n\\nThere was no way Yara would do that. The sight of him alone disgusted her, though it made a little part of her go wild.\\n\\nShe couldn’t understand why the moon goddess would bind them together when it was destined to end like this. They were not for each other. That was for sure…\\n\\n“Why? Because you are too afraid of the pain?” Yara asked mockingly, her breathing turned ragged as she struggled to get out of his deadly clutches.\\n\\n“No, because you are mine,” the alpha spoke sternly, he claimed her as his with his words and was about to put it into action when both of them heard the loud banging on the locked door.\\n\\n“Lucian! Yara! I know you are inside! What are you doing together?!” Lyra pounded the door with her fist, trying to open the door, but she was not able to do so. “Yara, I will not forgive you if you seduce him!”\\n\\nEven in her anger, Lyra didn’t forget to act, as Yara could hear a soft sobbing from behind the door, among the knocks.\\n\\nStartled, Lucian loosened his grip on Yara’s wrist and she used this chance to break free from him.\\n\\nYara ran toward the window and jumped from there, she was lucky enough that they were on the first floor of this tower, or else she would get some serious injuries.\\n\\nAt first, Yara thought she had managed to run away from her own mate, but as it turned out, Lucian decided to ignore Lyra and chase after her instead.\\n\\nYara felt her heart beat very fast as she sprung to her feet and started to run across the garden. She wouldn’t be able to outrun the alpha, especially when he came after her in his beast form.\\n\\nAs an alpha, of course, his black beast was huge and robust, it was only a matter of few seconds before he caught up to Yara.\\n\\nTherefore, she must think of another way out of his claws. Yara knew for sure what would happen if he got his hands on her. She was not that innocent and she could see it in his eyes.\\n\\nHis greed and lust…\\n\\nYara couldn’t hide either, since the beast could sniff her out in seconds.\\n\\nShe looked around her frantically and her gut feelings pushed her feet toward the nearest tower, which was filled with the king\\'s guards.\\n\\nEven from here, Yara could hear the sound of the paws of the beast that pounded the ground heavily in her background. This was not a good sign.\\n\\nHastily, Yara jumped over the fences and took a turn to her left, hiding behind the shadows of the trees, avoiding the guards, who were standing in front of the main door.\\n\\nSince the alpha’s beast presence was stronger than Yara’s, and knowing there was another werewolf in their beast form in their vicinity without warning, of course this put those guards on alert.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, they jumped forward in their beast form and snarled at their intruder.\\n\\nYara didn’t know what happened after that nor did she want to stay to find out what Lucian would do about those royal guards. She needed to save herself right now.\\n\\nHowever, the fight between the Alpha and the four royal guards attracted much attention from other guards around them and in no time the quiet hallway erupted in chaos.\\n\\nYara climbed the nearest window and got into the room, which smelled like paper and ink. A sweet and musky scent wafted into her nose.\\n\\nThis must be the library…\\n\\nYara knew this place. She had been here a couple of times when she needed some alone time and hurriedly found a safe corner for her to hide, while the commotion out there became louder.\\n\\nMost of the library was dark, but if Yara paid more attention, she should have known that she was not alone in this room.\\n\\nBut, it didn’t take her a long time before she stumbled on that fact, as someone knelt down before her with his face hidden behind a white mask.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara was startled, she felt her heart stop beating.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nHer eyes sang stories with sad endings.\\n\\nI wanted to wrap her in a blanket and tell her, she’d be safe forever, and so I did.\\n\\n-Atticus-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“What is that? Dageus, you should stay here.” Alarick, the royal beta, was used to being more casual when they were alone.\\n\\nAlarick then jumped to his feet when he heard the commotion from outside and immediately ran toward the door.\\n\\nDageus didn’t even bother to lift his head from the book in his hand when he noticed the commotion. Only when he smelled a refreshing scent of flowers inside the room, did he frown slightly and turned his head in the direction the scent came from.\\n\\nIt was certain by now that he was not alone inside this library. Someone had entered this room without permission. Was it the intruder\\'s accomplice?\\n\\nDageus stretched out his hand and took the mask on the table. He put it on his face and walked toward the place where the intruder was.\\n\\nHe was not surprised when he found a young girl with long red curly hair, sitting at the corner of the room, hugging her legs tightly and resting her head on her knees. Her small shoulders shook frantically, because of her ragged breathing.\\n\\nShe looked not harmful and fragile at the same time. What is this little thing doing here? She was not even aware that Dageus approached silently, even though they were quite close now.\\n\\nIn such a case, Dageus was sure that this little girl was not a shifter. She didn’t even have good senses to begin with.\\n\\nOnly when the great king knelt in front of her, did she finally lift her head and stared at him in disbelief. Her lips moved as she formed words that sounded like a whisper.\\n\\n“Your Majesty.” Yara was startled upon seeing those pair of pale blue eyes and the beautiful white mask before her eyes. Who else it would be if it was not the king himself?\\n\\nYara didn’t have any idea that she would meet the king here. Time was quite late already and most of the people had fallen into a deep slumber, especially since they just went through a long journey.\\n\\nFor a moment, their eyes met and Yara felt her heart stop beating under those pale blue eyes, staring at her with such intensity. She didn’t know whether the king was angry or not, or what he would do when he knew someone had sneaked into this place. Yara couldn’t even tell what kind of expression the king had behind that white mask.\\n\\nAnd as seconds went by with no one trying to break the spell of silence, all of a sudden, Yara saw a butterfly fluttering its wings near her eyes, which broke the eye contact between them.\\n\\nA butterfly?\\n\\nThis was almost winter, so there should be no butterflies around this time.\\n\\nHowever, it was not just one, as Yara was yet to overcome her surprise, another butterfly flew near her and then another…\\n\\nIn the end, there were dozens of butterflies flying around the room between the two of them and the flutter of wings from the small creatures filled the quiet atmosphere with a light buzz, which echoed through the dark library.\\n\\n“What is this?” Yara didn’t have any idea about what was going on at this moment. She raised her finger and a small yellow butterfly perched itself on her forefinger.\\n\\nYara’s eyes opened wide when she watched this in awe. She was not a delicate lady like Lyra, thus she had never thought that a beautiful creature like this would like her.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the king squinted his eyes at the girl before him and spoke with his rough and hoarse voice. “Who are you?”\\n\\nYara, once again, was startled. Because of the sudden appearance of the butterflies, she forgot about the king completely for a moment.\\n\\nThe young girl immediately lowered her head and put down her finger, which caused the butterfly to fly away.\\n\\n“Who are you?” Dageus asked again in a dark voice, he didn’t have much patience like normal people did. He stretched out his hand and pinned Yara’s chin between his fingers, tilting her head so he could see her eyes.\\n\\nDageus could see fear in those beautiful black eyes and certain that those butterflies were not her doing. She looked startled as well when she saw those creatures appeared all of a sudden.\\n\\n“My name is Yara, the daughter of Julius, the head healer of this place,” Yara spoke timidly, she tried to look elsewhere except those pale blue eyes, which seemingly pierced through her heart.\\n\\nWas the king going to kill her because she had trespassed his place? In that sense, she was pretty sure, even her father wouldn’t bother to help her.\\n\\n“I am sorry for trespassing, but I was running away from…” Yara bit down on her lips, she couldn’t decide whether it was right or not to tell the king about the alpha.\\n\\nHowever, before Yara could explain any further, the king grabbed her hand all of a sudden and pulled her up. She could only stand up nimbly and almost fell forward because of the sudden movement. Fortunately, the Alpha had some impressive reflexes, thus instead of falling face first on the floor, Yara bumped onto his sturdy chest.\\n\\nShe was about to struggle to get free from him, when her body was covered with his cloak, as the king lazily hugged her.\\n\\n“Stay still,” he said in a deep voice that was enough to make Yara stop struggling. “What is it?” This time, the king spoke to someone else, who had entered the room.\\n\\n“It is Alpha Lucian. He said someone from his pack had trespassed this place, so he was trying to chase after that person…” Alarick stopped mid-sentence when he caught another scent in the air and realized that someone was near the king. “Dageus...”\\n\\n“Tell him, there is no one here.” Dageus cut off Alarick suddenly.\\n\\n“But, who…” Alarick was flabbergasted.\\n\\n“She is mine,” he said simply.\\n\\n..............................................................................\\nWhen a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\\n\\n-Alexander Den Heijer-\\n\\n**************\\n\\n“She is mine,” Dageus said simply with authority. He wrapped Yara’s body with his cloak and told Alarick to get out of the room. “Step back.”\\n\\nAlarick was stunned and confused. What was happening? He just left this room for a few minutes, but the king was acting strangely now. Who was that woman?\\n\\nThe beta knew that it must be a woman, since there was no way a man smelled like that. Was she the person that alpha Lucian was looking for? The trespasser?\\n\\n“Is she…” Alarick still stood in the same place.\\n\\n“You have seen nothing.” Dageus emphasized his words firmly and then stared impassively at the beta until he walked out of the room.\\n\\nSure thing, a woman wouldn’t be able to hurt Dageus, even though he was not in his best condition.\\n\\nAfter that, Alarick told the guards to tell Alpha Lucian that the person he was looking for was not inside. Albeit, he didn’t know why Dageus wanted to keep the woman, since it was not his habit for having a woman close to him.\\n\\nYet, if the king didn’t want to say anything about it, then he couldn’t say otherwise or force him to do so.\\n\\nMeanwhile, inside the library, once Alarick stepped outside of the room, Dageus released Yara from his embrace and stared deeply into her eyes.\\n\\n“Your majesty…” Yara wanted to thank him for doing that for her. She was sure that something unpleasant would wait for her if the king gave her to Lucian.\\n\\nHowever, Dageus shut her up with just one glare. That was enough for Yara to understand that she had to be quiet.\\n\\nAfter that, the king pulled up his shirt sleeve and there, on the surface of his skin, Yara could see a dark line, adorning his skin. Like a random intricate mark that looked like a tattoo.\\n\\nYara didn’t know why the king showed her this, but she was sure that she was not allowed to speak or move recklessly without his permission.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, the king grabbed her hand again and placed it on his tattooed arm, where the dark mark was, and witnessed something unbelievable happen.\\n\\nSomething that even made Dageus’ pale blue eyes widen in surprise.\\n\\nThe dark mark, eventually, faded away, as if Yara’s touch had eradicated it and left nothing on his skin.\\n\\n“What is that?” Yara whispered. She stared at what was happening before her eyes with disbelief. She was not sure whether it was because of her, or there was another explanation for that.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus asked, squinting his eyes dangerously at Yara. This dark mark was a result of the curse that he got when he fought the Dark Magus and not even the best healer of this country knew what it was. Yet Yara healed him only with a simple touch of hers?\\n\\nAt this point, no one was leisure enough to care about the butterflies that were fluttering their wings around them. Those beautiful creatures, lost their attractiveness now.\\n\\nActually, Dageus had realized this already when he touched Yara for the first time. The moment he clasped her chin with his fingers, he witnessed how the dark mark around the fingers that touched her, slowly faded away, just like the one on his arm.\\n\\nAnd now, he had irrefutable evidence that it was Yara who cured him. Only with her touch? Was that even possible?\\n\\nHowever, Dageus couldn’t deny the fact before his eyes.\\n\\n“How can you do this?” Dageus repeated his words impatiently, as he grabbed Yara’s hand and held her tightly.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Yara said, shaking her head vigorously. “I don’t know how I can do this…” she was telling the truth. Even she was shocked with what she had done.\\n\\nAnd when the dark mark around Dageus’s arm had totally disappeared, he moved Yara’s hand to his upper arm, where another dark mark could be seen.\\n\\nYara blinked her eyes, thinking of something…\\n\\nYara used to think that she was not born with the ability as a healer, but then again, how was she able to cure the king when even her father didn\\'t have any idea about his injuries?\\n\\nAnd the main question was, where else were the dark marks on his body? If they adorned his whole body, should she touch him all over to get rid of all that?\\n\\nAnd then, as if answering Yara’s unspoken question, when the dark mark on his upper arm had gone, the king stepped back and shrugged off his outer cloak along with his shirt and tossed them recklessly.\\n\\nSeeing that, Yara was dumbstruck. Not because of the sight before her eyes, but the fact that she needed to touch him, to do that magic…\\n\\n“No… no…” Yara raised her hands and backed away. She was startled, since this was her first time seeing a man half naked this close.\\n\\nWhen Lucian set her up to see him with her sister, Yara only saw their shadows and heard their obscene moans, therefore, she was trembling to see the king\\'s sudden actions, confused about what she should do.\\n\\nFortunately, the king stopped approaching her and turned around to pick up his clothes again, as he spoke. “Why was Lucian looking for you?” he asked with the same hoarse tone, while wearing back his clothes before approaching Yara, who was standing in the same spot, seemingly couldn’t move an inch from there.\\n\\n“He…” Yara bit her lips and lowered her head. It was kind of embarrassing to say something like this, yet the king demanded an answer from her.\\n\\nOnce again, the king loomed over her small figure. Now Yara realized that the tip of her head only reached the king’s shoulder, which was twice the size of her own. She was sure he was taller, bigger and sturdier than Lucian.\\n\\n“What \\'he\\'?” Dageus demanded.\\n\\n“He is my mate…” Yara clenched the hem of her dress and this gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Dageus.\\n\\n“You will come with me, back to my pack.” He then added. “You are mine now.”\\n💡Download App: 【KeeNovel】\\n👉 Search for book title \"The Possessive Alpha King\" to read more exciting contents.', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n🔞😍Click to read more free content 📜The Possessive Alpha King\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Keenovel', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'NO Facebook ID found', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'ID: 100117649215571', 'insta_followers': 131, 'static_id': '100117649215571', 'ads_count': 8, 'cumulative_ads_count': 8, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 18:18:19', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'skin'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'Romance novel', 'ad_occurance': 9, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 100730365919012', 'page_likes': 2721, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '100730365919012', 'ads_count': 87, 'cumulative_ads_count': 557, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:52:16', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n💔All Too Late\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:52:40', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n💔All Too Late\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:52:53', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n💔All Too Late\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:53:06', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you’re still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nChapter 2 Help Me Hide It\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nChapter 3 Leukemia\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 960, 'days': '08/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-08 01:35:28,2022-09-06 21:53:43', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,works\\\\worked'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you’re still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nChapter 2 Help Me Hide It\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nChapter 3 Leukemia\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 0, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 960, 'days': '08/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-08 01:35:45,2022-09-06 21:54:07', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,works\\\\worked'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you’re still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nChapter 2 Help Me Hide It\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nChapter 3 Leukemia\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n😍😍Click to READ more👉👉Book title “All Too Late”\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 2488, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 960, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:54:31', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you’re still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nChapter 2 Help Me Hide It\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nChapter 3 Leukemia\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n😍😍Click to READ more👉👉Book title “All Too Late”\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 2488, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 960, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:54:44', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you’re still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nChapter 2 Help Me Hide It\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nChapter 3 Leukemia\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n😍😍Click to READ more👉👉Book title “All Too Late”\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Joynovel Stories', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101240422184383', 'page_likes': 2488, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101240422184383', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 960, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:54:57', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world.\\n————————————————————\\nChapter 1 Homecoming\\n“Scarlett! Please hurry up I don’t want your brother having to wait so long!” Jessica shouted up the stairs to her daughter.\\n\\n“Kk Mama! I know, relax!” She called back.\\n\\nScarlett rolled her eyes applying her trademark red lipstick. If you got it why not flaunt it? She thought to herself as she stared in the mirror at her reflection. Staring back at her was a beautiful young woman with strawberry choppy shoulder-length hair which was dyed in an ombre style, the bottom half a vivid red. Plumping up her hair she stood up and grabbed her car keys. She loved being eighteen - having received her car from her mother and stepfather on her birthday a few months ago.\\n\\nDespite turning 18, the age that most young werewolves found their mates, Scarlett had not. She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world. For now, she’d simply focus on herself. She had felt her wolf awaken, felt her presence in her mind and had shifted to a magnificent grey wolf. It had been bigger than most wolves in their town, something that had caused rumours to spread around the town, no one knew her mother\\'s mate had been an alpha. But her wolf had been a dead giveaway to that.\\n\\nShe rushed out of her room almost bumping into her fourteen-year-old sister Indigo.\\n\\n“Careful witch,” Indigo snapped, earning herself a glare from Scarlett.\\n\\n“I’m getting late Indy, I have to collect Elijah from the airport,” she said running down the steps, taking two at a time and skipping the last four. Her feet hitting the dark wooden floorboards with a thud.\\n\\n“Scarlett… calm down,” Jessica said stepping out of the mansion kitchen. She had an apron on and her black hair pulled into a messy bun. From the splashes of flour Scarlett noted she must have been working on another cake order. Despite being a werewolf, Jessica was a well-known and in-demand baker in Stratford-Upon-Avon. It was something that kept her busy and her mind off things.\\n\\nDespite being the Luna to the Blood Moon Pack, Jessica was not fully acknowledged by the pack members. It had been years since they had joined their pack - after the first Luna was killed in a rogue attack which had left the pack devastated. When Jessica had stepped into the broken alphas life the pack had mixed emotions, with some glad that their alpha would not go insane after the loss of his Luna and others uncertain if anyone could replace their alphas mate, finding her entering his life a disrespect to their previous Luna.\\n\\n“Make up your mind! Do you want me to hurry or not?” Scarlett said, not waiting for a reply as she rushed from the house crossing the green lawn and getting into her white Ford Fiesta.\\n\\nScarlett lived near the beautiful town of Stratford-Upon-Avon with woods surrounding their pack area. It was a small place but with plenty of open grounds, perfect for their pack - The Blood Moon. Most of the pack members lived in the pack area but some lived in the town amongst the humans and would come to the woods for a run or pack meetings.\\n\\nThe Alpha, Jackson Westwood, was her stepfather and owned the area. He had his own businesses that helped support the pack financially. Despite his pack only having around 500 members, he was still a strong and fair alpha.\\n\\nThe sun was high in the sky and she lowered her window slightly, putting some EDM music on. Tapping the steering wheel with her freshly painted nails. It was roughly a 50-minute drive to Birmingham, the closest airport to their town, and she was glad for the time to mentally prepare to see him again…\\n\\nSighing she lent back in her seat, Elijah Westwood. The son of her stepfather, the future Alpha of The Blood Moon Pack. She had not seen him for the last two years, it was two summers ago when he had visited from his extensive alpha training around the country, that was when she had realised she was crushing on her own stepbrother. The very thought made her internally cringe. A thought she would not dare utter aloud.\\n\\nShe felt nervous now, wondering if those feelings would be gone, she hoped so, not wanting things to become awkward between them. Although Elijah was not the nicest towards her, always teasing, taunting, or trying to embarrass her. She had been so glad when he first left town five years ago, thinking good riddance.\\n\\nBut when he had returned two summers ago, she had seen him completely differently. Now with his training complete, and returning home permanently, he would become alpha soon enough whilst Jackson would step down. She always knew Elijah was a very handsome young man. He had delicious chocolate locks with natural streaks lightened by the sun and those piercing blue eyes...\\n\\n“Fuck…” She muttered. Do not let yourself go down that train of thought Scarlett… Not now. Not ever.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe airport was a rush with people leaving and entering, taxis and cars parked all around. She struggled to find a parking space before squeezing herself into a very tight spot, then realising she could not open her side door. Groaning in frustration she climbed over to the passenger seat and got out. She had failed four tests before passing and bay parking was still not one of her strong points…\\n\\nEntering the airport she scanned the Flight Information Display. The flight had landed thirty minutes ago. She pouted crossing her arms, hoping she wasn’t too late. It did take time to collect your luggage, right?\\n\\n“Finally… Why am I not surprised?” A drawling voice came from behind her, she spun around knocking into someone.\\n\\n“Ouch fuck! That hurt!” Scarlett groaned. Massaging her breast she looked up to glare at the brick-like man she had just knocked into, freezing when she looked into her step-brother\\'s cocky face. The scent of winter spice, vanilla and white musk enveloped her senses.\\n\\n“Need some help massaging that?” He asked, his eyes flitting down to her breasts, she blushed glaring at him.\\n\\n“Oh shut up Elijah,” she replied rolling her eyes.\\n\\n“What\\'s wrong? Can’t big brother take care of his precious little sister?” He mocked. His words ignited a forbidden pleasure within her. “I promise to take good care of you… Just say the word Red…” His breath tickled her ear, her heart pounded in her chest.\\n\\nShe shoved him away from her, trying not to notice the way his chest felt under her fingers. He looked incredible, sexier than she remembered, had he grown a little more? Towering over six foot, he was definitely a lot bulkier than before. His skin was tanned and a light stubble covered his jaw. Dressed in ripped jeans, a white T-shirt, a leather jacket and Nike trainers he looked effortlessly good. He was the typical alpha male - drop-dead gorgeous.\\n\\n“Stop being an ass, it\\'s clear you haven\\'t changed.” She said glaring at him. He looked down at her, she smelt… delicious.\\n\\n“You’ve changed a lot though… I was beginning to think the Instagram posts may have all been photo-shopped and edited… clearly not…”He said, his eyes trailing over her 5-foot-2 frame and taking in her curves. She was on the smaller side for a she-wolf but he liked it. Trying not to linger on the way her black top stretched at the bust, paired with blue skinny jeans and black heels boots she looked effortlessly hot. She did not look like a young girl anymore - now grown into a hot sexy woman. (that much was for sure, he was not blind to deny that.) He wasn’t blind and no matter who she was, he couldn’t deny it.\\n\\n“If you\\'re done being annoying, shall we go? I don’t have all day.” She said leading the way out. Elijah smirked as he followed her, his eyes falling on her ass, she really did fill out nicely. Her Instagram only held selfies or food pictures. Summer was sure going to be fun…\\n\\nThey reached the car soon after and she unlocked it opening the boot for him, he tossed in his suitcase and duffel bag, walking around to the passenger seat.\\n\\n“Wait let me get in first,” she said. He raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n“What? Did you smash in the other door?”\\n\\n“No, the parking spot was tight.” She said, sliding in and over to the driver\\'s seat before he got in. A rich white floral scent filled the car, hers.\\n\\n“The parking spot was fine, you parked wrong.” He remarked as she started the car.\\n\\n“Buckle up,” Scarlett said ignoring his remark.\\n\\n“Worried for me?” He teased, smirking when she glared at him.\\n\\n“No, but it\\'s my car, so my rules.” She said reversing out of the spot, very aware of his observation. He ignored her refusing to put the belt on, fiddling with her playlist. Sitting back when ‘Or Nah’ by Somo began playing.\\n\\nShe kept her eyes on the road trying not to focus on the words of the song. The words a little too much, and with Elijah in the car… The image in her head was not a decent one…\\n\\n“So how come you were sent to get me?” He asked looking over at the feisty redhead.\\n\\n“Last minute meeting with some alpha popped up and you know dad, work comes first.” She replied, making Elijah frown. It irked him when she called his dad, ‘dad’.\\n\\n“Makes sense.” He said not letting his annoyance show.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you just run the rest of the way back?” She asked. Her wolf seemed to agree with her. Although having a wolf you did not have a second voice in your head, you could feel their emotions and sense their opinions. Like a second conscience.\\n\\n“Luggage darling,” he said tauntingly, earning a frown from the young woman. “What about Jessica, busy baking?”\\n\\n“Yep, I thought she didn’t have anything today but some last-minute order came in and like they say, what was the point of buying me a car if I can’t be of some use?”\\n\\nElijah smirked “I agree, freeloader.” He said poking the side of her head, making her glare at him once again.\\n\\n“I am not a freeloader, I help at the restaurant on weekends… and I\\'m working at a salon too…” She said, her glare fading. Unlike Elijah, the smart intelligent - pride of the family. She had been a disappointment, doing a beauty course in college she went on to apply at a local human salon. Something her parents had not been happy about, wanting her to get a degree like Elijah, who aside from his alpha duties had a business degree under his belt.\\n\\n“Cool. I like the hair, it suits you.” He said. Growing up she had gone from purples to blues, and pinks, but this was the reddest he had seen it and it looked pretty hot on her.\\n\\n“Thanks,” she replied suspiciously. “So are you hungry? Shall we stop at a service station?”\\n\\n“Yeah lets, I\\'m fucking starved, you know the food on the plane is not edible.” He said pushing his seat as far back as possible and stretching his long legs a little.\\n\\n“It isn\\'t so bad.” She said amused. She kept her eyes open for a sign that told them a service station was approaching.\\n\\nChapter 2 An Unexpected Visitor\\nIt was twenty minutes later, and both walked into the service station. Ordering some McDonalds, Elijah carried the tray to the table.\\n\\n“I can’t believe you can still eat four big macs…” She said, staring at his abs. He was an alpha after all and guess with all the working out he needed it.\\n\\n“I\\'m a big boy, Red, I need fuel.” He replied, as they took a seat opposite each other. She took her fish fillet meal and unwrapping her burger, looked across at him. Once again, her stomach did a flip when their eyes met.\\n\\n“Are you still single? Or have you found a man that can tame that temper of yours?” He asked, biting into his burger, thinking he doubted she was single; boys had always found her sexy and hot. But it was her feisty temper that never got them far. But looking at her now, there was no way she was single. And he knew she had not found her mate or there would have been a mark on her neck.\\n\\n“Very funny Elijah, how about you? Are you still a fuckboy or have you found your mate who can tame your wild ways?\" She asked, avoiding his question as she imitated the tone he had used. Knowing he hadn’t, or the entire pack would have known. Elijah smirked.\\n\\n“I like my wild ways... there are no rules when it comes to me.” He said, leaning forward as he winked at her. Her heart thudded in her chest.\\n\\n“What does that even mean?” she asked sipping her drink.\\n\\n“Figure it out, Red, figure it out…” Elijah said. His eyes fell on those red lips of hers, the way they wrapped around that straw… The way she licked her lips.\\n\\nHe frowned, what the fuck was his problem. She was his stepsister, and he was checking her out a little too much… He needed to get a woman tonight, release all the pent-up energy he seemed to have inside of him.\\n\\n“Wasn’t there a blood moon like a month ago?” He asked after a moment. For werewolves, they could only find their mate on a blood moon. Something that occurred two nights in a year. It was on these nights that the bond snapped into place, as long as your mate was nearby.\\n\\n“Yes, there was.” She said, curtly frowning at her burger. If she had found her mate, perhaps these stupid feelings would have gone away.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nThey were back on the road. With twenty minutes left before they got home. Elijah was bopping his knee to the music. Every now and then his gaze going to the feisty redhead in the driver\\'s seat. Her choppy red hair hiding half her face, as she moved her body to the music.\\n\\nSuddenly, he saw a blur flash past the car.\\n\\n“Watch out!” He shouted, grabbing the steering wheel, and jerking it to the left. Scarlett let out a startled scream as she was thrown into him.\\n\\nThe car flipped over as something big hit the car. A crunch of metal made Scarlett wince, feeling a painful ache in her waist until she felt a hand that sent pleasant tingles through her when he touched her there.\\n\\nFuck Red, you\\'re bleeding.” He murmured, receiving a groan of pain in response. “Hush I got you.”\\n\\nKicking the door off its hinges, he rolled out, cradling her body to his chest. Standing up, he looked at the three wolves that stood there growling. He could smell they weren\\'t rogues. Two were rather big, definitely a beta and a delta.\\n\\n“What do you want?” Elijah asked icily, moving Scarlett behind him defensively. His large body covering her much smaller one.\\n\\nThe largest wolf shifted into a young man. wearing nothing, and not even phased by it. Something that was normal with werewolves. He looked around 21. His sharp brown eyes met Elijah’s blue ones. A sharp wind blew past them, rustling the grass on the roadsides.\\n\\n“Her, leave her and you are welcome to pass.\" He said, Scarlett froze, why did they want her? Elijah raised an eyebrow\\n\\n“You’re talking to a fucking alpha. I don’t obey fucking orders. I give them.” He growled, his voice deepening.\\n\\nThe man raised his hand, stepping back.\\n\\n“I get that… but can I speak to her?” He asked tersely. Elijah growled again, ready to shift, but Scarlett placed a hand on his arm and stepped out from behind him.\\n\\n“Scarlett…” The man said, making her frown. “It’s Cade. You may not remember me, but I sure as hell can recognise those green eyes anywhere.”\\n\\nScarlett froze, her heart thumping. Cade. There was only one Cade she knew, and he should be a hundred miles away in her father’s pack. Her heart thumped in her chest. Elijah looked at her sharply. He could hear the thudding in her chest and smell the fear in the air.\\n\\nHe placed a hand instinctively around her waist, pulling her close, glaring at Cade threateningly.\\n\\n“Mates?” Cade asked, making Scarlett blush despite the seriousness of the situation.\\n\\n“Maybe,” Elijah growled, feeling a strong sense of possessiveness the way Cade was looking at her and talking to her. “Can someone share how the fuck you two know each other?”\\n\\n“He’s from my old pack.” Scarlett said quietly, very aware of every ridge of his body, her chest pressed against his. Elijah looked momentarily surprised.\\n\\n“And you need to return and take your place.” Cade said, watching them calmly, realising they did not smell the same. And from what he could see, neither was marked. “I\\'m the new beta, the beta that will take his place by your-”\\n\\n“Just leave! I don’t want anything to do with that pack! Now leave before I tear you all to pieces!\" She growled, her eyes flashing dangerously. Only Jackson knew her father was an alpha, despite all the rumours since the night of her first shift. But they had wanted to keep it a secret, the fact that her father had traced them this far... Meant he knew exactly where they were living.\\n\\nCade frowned, signalling to the two wolves by his side to attack. Scarlett turned ready to fight, a spasming pain ricocheting up her side but the wolves were aiming for Elijah. Who had shifted into a magnificent light brown wolf, his fur was glossy.\\n\\nHe was huge, bigger than before Scarlett thought in awe. He clearly stood over 5 feet in height on all fours, and he was larger than any alpha wolf Scarlett had seen before.\\n\\nHe lunged at the wolves before they even got to him, biting into one of their necks as he ripped it clean off the body. Blood splattered everywhere. His paw slashing through the other wolves chest.\\n\\nWhen the first wolf fell to the ground dead, shifting into the body of a decapitated human. Cade must have mind linked something to the second wolf, who quickly retreated. Elijah shifted to his human form, a strong aura surrounding him. His alpha power emanating from him.\\n\\n“Tell your alpha, there\\'s no fucking way he’s getting Scarlett. Whatever his reasons, try to attack or reach out to her one more time and I will take it as a personal attack. You don’t want to get on the wrong side of future Alpha Elijah Westwood of The Blood Moon Pack and we’re ready for war.\" He said his voice was dangerous and deep.\\n\\nCade frowned and nodded, casting one last glance at Scarlett.\\n\\n“You can’t run from your birthright...\" He mumbled before turning, shifting, and running off.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath, and it was then she realised that Elijah was stood ass naked in front of her. He turned, and she quickly closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Clothes!” She shrieked, Elijah raised an eyebrow, looking down.\\n\\n“What are you, a baby? Never seen a cock before?” He asked, thinking she had no problem with that other guy’s dick on show.\\n\\n“Of course I have. I just don’t want to be traumatised for life by seeing yours!” She said, wincing at the sting of pain in her side.\\n\\n“Whatever you say, Red, every woman would beg to get one look at mine.\" His cocky reply came.\\n\\n“I\\'m your sister, remember?\" She retorted, her eyes still averted, knowing if she looked, she would just have even more vivid images to dream over. He did not reply, flipping the wrecked car onto all fours and opening the boot. Taking out his duffel bag, he pulled on a pair of pants.\\n\\n“You can look now, prude.” He remarked, walking over to her as she rolled her eyes. Knowing she was hiding something. He had not missed how she had cut the guy off, or the fear that rolled off her. But now was not the time to ask. Reaching for the hem of her black top, he tore it off her, making her gasp.\\n\\n“What are you doing!” She shrieked, covering her breasts in the lacy red bra with her arms. Not that it covered much, he thought. She was a decent-sized cup, not huge and not small either. The perfect size for his hands, he thought, frowning as he pushed the thought away. She was his stepsister, he reminded himself. His eyes moved from her tempting breasts to her waist before he crouched down\\n\\n“It’ll heal, although it is pretty deep.” He said, about to touch it when she grabbed his arms. Glaring at him despite the very faint blush on her cheeks. He raised an eyebrow, smirking at her embarrassment, not knowing it was their close proximity that was getting to her. Taking her wrists, he held them against the car still crouching before her.\\n\\n“What are you doing?!” She yelped, her heart hammering. Was she dreaming? Her core throbbed and his rough move had only made matters worse.\\n\\n“It’ll heal quicker.\" He said huskily, he leaned in, not missing her thudding heart. And ran his tongue along the wound slowly. She gasped as pleasure erupted through her. Her eye lids fluttered shut, her core aching with pleasure. As his tongue slowly ran up her hip, across her waist, and stopped just below her breast.\\n\\nHe inhaled her tempting scent, the feel of her skin and the sweet taste of her blood. Alpha saliva had healing abilities, although more so in wolf form. He knew she would have healed soon enough, but seeing her there in her bra had awakened something inside him, and he had wanted to feel her smooth skin against his lips...\\n\\nHe looked up, past her perfect mounds. Not missing the hardened buds, which sent blood rushing down south. Slowly shifting his gaze to her flushed face, just as their eyes met, the scent of her arousal hit him like an intoxicating avalanche…\\n\\nChapter 3 Bubble Butt\\nCerulean blue eyes met sage green. Scarlett’s heart thundered in her chest as Elijah stood up slowly, his gaze shifting to her red tempting lips. He licked his plush lips slowly and she did not miss the piercing on his tongue making her eyes widen slightly. He forced his gaze away, trying not to get lost in the scent of her arousal. What the fuck were they doing?\\n\\nHe looked at the car, his back now to her, two tyres were flat and there was no way they were going to be driving it home.\\n\\n“Shift… we’ll have to run, I’ll mind link someone to collect the car and stuff.” He said trying not to look at her.\\n\\n“Um sure..” Her reply came, sounding rather normal despite the crazy storm in her head. ‘Fuck! He smelt my arousal! No wonder he’s not even looking at me!’ she thought frustrated. She did not really want to shift but there really was no other option.\\n\\nThey both shifted and Elijah once again looked at her in surprise, it was not only her stunning grey-white fur that stood out, but she was big - over 4 and a half foot tall. That was the size of an average alpha. She saw his curious gaze.\\n\\n\\'How the fuck are you so big?\\' He asked through the mind link.\\n\\n\\'Luck?\\' came her not so helpful reply as she broke into a run and ran towards home as fast as possible. He gave a wolfish grin, his wolf enjoying the thought of playing chase with a female. He ran after her, impressed with her speed, as he followed keeping up with her he had to quicken his own pace. It was not like chasing a normal wolf, that was something an alpha wolf could do with ease…\\n\\nHe nipped playfully at her as he brushed past her, causing her to slow down for a fraction of a second making him chuckle in his head.\\n\\n\\'What happened Red?\\' He teased.\\n\\n\\'Don’t mess with me Elijah!\\' She retorted, lunging at his back, wincing as her side made impact with him. He grunted as he stumbled tossing her wolf off him, she grabbed on to his neck with her jaw and both tumbled down the hill, laughing in their heads.\\n\\n\\'Foul play there sweetheart!\\' His mocking voice came, making her heart pound and core throb once more.\\n\\n\\'All’s fair in love and war, and this is war!\\' She replied through the link as he licked her face, making her growl.\\n\\n“Are you two done?” A male voice came laughing heartily. Both wolves looked up to see they had reached pack borders and none other than the alpha stood there. The wolves sprang away from each other as if caught doing something wrong, something that only crossed both of their minds and no one else\\'s.\\n\\nJackson smiled down at his son. “Welcome home son.”\\n\\n\\'Glad to be back.\\' Elijah replied as one of the wolves accompanying the alpha tossed them both some clothes. Both took them in their mouths and went to change behind some trees.\\n\\nScarlett’s heart was pounding, what had happened? Elijah had never been so… playful. Pulling on the black baggy tee that fell to mid-thigh she stepped out from behind the tree, her side still aching, although the bleeding had lessened. Being an alpha blooded she-wolf she healed faster than the normal wolf and she was sure Elijah had helped… A blush faintly dusted her cheek, but she schooled her face into passiveness before she walked over to where Elijah was hugging his father. Although both men were over six foot, Elijah was clearly the bigger one.\\n\\n“Ah, there you are? What happened to the car?” Jackson asked placing an arm around Scarlett’s shoulder once he moved back from Elijah.\\n\\n“We were ambushed.” Elijah said glancing at Scarlett who had tensed.\\n\\n“Rogues?” Jackson said with a frown.\\n\\n“Yes!” Scarlett said quickly, making both alpha’s look at her. Elijah raised an eyebrow questioningly.\\n\\n\\'What the fuck do you mean yes?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not now… please I’ll explain later\\' she pleaded through the link.\\n\\n“Hmm, it\\'s strange that there are rogues out so close to the pack borders…” Jackson said seriously.\\n\\n“Just a stray lone wolf, don’t stress it, I got Hank to get the car and stuff.” Elijah said, Jackson nodded.\\n\\n“That’s my son.” He said then looked at Scarlett, “Now how about we go home, your mother has definitely cooked a five-course meal.”\\n\\n“You know her dad, she loves the kitchen.” Scarlett said as Jackson kissed her forehead tenderly. Elijah watched the exchange with slight annoyance. He never understood why his father had to treat the girls as his own daughters… Although he knew he was being biased considering he treated Indigo like his little sister.\\n\\nSpeaking of the pixie…\\n\\n“Elijahhh!” She shrieked lunging onto Elijah’s bare back and kissing his cheek. “You’re home!!!”\\n\\n“Yeah, and I’ll probably be deaf if you continue to scream in my ear!” He said as he cupped her behind her knees carrying her piggyback style.\\n\\n“Oh, it\\'s ok I\\'m sure you’ll still be loved even if you do go deaf.” Indigo replied as Scarlett looked back at them. “Hey witch, why do you have blood dripping down your leg?”\\n\\nAll eyes went to Scarlett’s legs, although Elijah’s gaze had gone to her inner thighs first before realising blood was dripping down from her waist.\\n\\n“Oh, I hurt it a little, I\\'m fine.” Scarlett said as Jackson looked very concerned.\\n\\n“Oh no dear, this is not good, Elijah couldn\\'t you protect your sister?” He said worriedly scooping her up bridal style, making Elijah frown and Indigo roll her eyes.\\n\\n“Daddy’s girl.” She muttered as Jackson hurriedly broke into a run.\\n\\n“I\\'m fine dad, really!” Scarlett protested, as they made their way down the winding path and through the trees. The slightly cloudy skies could be seen through the treetops.\\n\\n“Attention seeker.” Elijah retorted. The two really annoyed him, he hated their relationship. He stalked past them with indigo on his back as she stuck her tongue out at Scarlett.\\n\\n“Ignore them, Elijah she’s just a spoilt brat.” She said making Scarlett frown and Elijah nod in agreement before they both ran off towards home.\\n\\nJackson shook his head as a sharp wind blew, messing up both their hair, making Scarlett blow a few strands of hers out of her face.\\n\\n“Ignore them two.” He said knowing they always picked on her. “Although I thought you and Elijah may have been putting your differences aside but seems not.”\\n\\n“That won’t ever happen.” Scarlett huffed as they walked through the green fields approaching the woods that surrounded the small pack village area. Jackson chuckled as he agreed reluctantly.\\n\\n“Siblings. What can I say? You’re both headstrong.”\\n\\nScarlett didn’t reply feeling a sense of guilt filling her, she didn’t think of her stepbrother in a brotherly way at all…\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt was later in the evening and after getting her checked by the pack doctor Jackson had bought her home. She had showered, donning a pair of black leggings and a V neck purple tee. The smell of freshly cooked chicken, roasted potatoes, southern fried chicken strips, stuffed peppers, and lasagne wafted into her room. She loved her mother’s cooking. It always felt nice when the weather changed for the worse. It was pouring down outside unlike the clear sky earlier. The joys of British weather she thought morbidly. She did like the rain as long as she was inside but going out in it wasn’t the most enjoyable thing.\\n\\nShe heard the creak of the wooden floorboards outside her room and knew someone was going down the hall, the downside of a traditional style house. It was a large house, the largest in the territory, with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, an office, 2 lounges, game room, a gym room in the basement, kitchen and a dining room. It was a nice old English style brick building with dark-framed windows.\\n\\n“Oi Scar! Come make your mighty presence known at Simba’s coronation!” Indigo shouted. Scarlett closed her eyes and sighed pinching the bridge of her nose.\\n\\n“Shut the hell up Indy!” She snapped back, hating the nicknames her sister had for her.\\n\\n“You know if you got hurt on your face today you would have looked even more like Scar….” Indy’s voice came giggling as she ran off down the hall.\\n\\nScarlett exited her room after donning a pair of black block heels. She didn’t like walking barefoot in the house. Indy simply said it was because she was a midget. Maybe it was true, she felt a little short for werewolf standards…\\n\\nShe walked down the steps, her fingers brushing the dark wooden balcony rail, stopping in her tracks when she saw the front door open. A strong draft of cold air entering the warm house, accompanied by the smell of wet earth and the sweet scent of Fiona Williamson. The girl was stood leaning against the door frame, wearing a white leather skirt, a pale pink peplum blouse and a white leather jacket. Her long tan legs on show, she was a stunning twenty-one-year-old. Scarlett had to admit it with her 5,8 height, long brown waves, and those big hazel eyes...\\n\\nElijah was looking down at her with a smirk on his face, clearly flirting, Scarlett felt a pang of jealousy go through her as she frowned slightly averting her gaze and stalked towards the kitchen.\\n\\n“Oh hey Scarlett.” Fiona said smiling sweetly, stopping Scarlett in her tracks. Elijah turned his gaze falling to her perfect peach, thinking fuck did she have to wear such skimpy clothing… the leggings stuck to her like a second skin shaping her ass so fucking sexily. He was not used to seeing her look this good.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath before plastering a smile on her face and turned.\\n\\n“Oh hey Fiona, I didn’t see you there.” She said making Elijah raise an eyebrow.\\n\\n“Really? She’s hard to miss Red… looking this gorgeous anyway…”He added making Fiona blush and pat his chest playfully, Scarlett rolled her eyes.\\n\\n“I know, she really is, but it’s your big fat ass that blocked my entire view.” She retorted making Fiona smile.\\n\\n“This ass is far from fat wouldn’t you agree Fiona?”He said playing with a strand of her long brown hair.\\n\\n“Definitely anything but fat…” She said blushing.\\n\\n“Awe how cute! Well as much as I would love to stay and chat - I really don’t want to discuss Elijah’s ass. Plus I’m really hungry.” Scarlett said crossing her arms, only making Elijah’s eyes fall to her breasts for a split second.\\n\\nFiona laughed “Then I won’t keep you, nice seeing you Scarlett.”\\n\\n“Mm..” Scarlett replied.\\n\\n“Yeah, you should go eat, that ass is definitely not all muscle.” He snickered, making Scarlett turn and glare at him before she stormed off into the kitchen that was glowing welcomingly.\\n\\n“Be nice to her Elijah.” Fiona said in a flirtier tone, “So… I’ll see you tonight?”\\n\\n“Sure… See you tonight, leave your window open.” He whispered into her ear, kissing her jaw before stepping away. Fiona nodded before she walked off swaying her hips on purpose. Elijah glanced at her, thinking she had a fine ass but there was something about Scarlett’s sexy bubble butt that made him hard just thinking about it. He glanced down at the front of his pants, adjusting them, and thinking he really needed to meet Fiona tonight…\\n————————————\\n💋Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here\\nInstall the APP to search for the book title 👉\"Her Forbidden Alpha\" 👈Read more exciting content immediately.', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n😘 Install APP to read more 👉👉Her Forbidden Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:55:15', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world.\\n————————————————————\\nChapter 1 Homecoming\\n“Scarlett! Please hurry up I don’t want your brother having to wait so long!” Jessica shouted up the stairs to her daughter.\\n\\n“Kk Mama! I know, relax!” She called back.\\n\\nScarlett rolled her eyes applying her trademark red lipstick. If you got it why not flaunt it? She thought to herself as she stared in the mirror at her reflection. Staring back at her was a beautiful young woman with strawberry choppy shoulder-length hair which was dyed in an ombre style, the bottom half a vivid red. Plumping up her hair she stood up and grabbed her car keys. She loved being eighteen - having received her car from her mother and stepfather on her birthday a few months ago.\\n\\nDespite turning 18, the age that most young werewolves found their mates, Scarlett had not. She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world. For now, she’d simply focus on herself. She had felt her wolf awaken, felt her presence in her mind and had shifted to a magnificent grey wolf. It had been bigger than most wolves in their town, something that had caused rumours to spread around the town, no one knew her mother\\'s mate had been an alpha. But her wolf had been a dead giveaway to that.\\n\\nShe rushed out of her room almost bumping into her fourteen-year-old sister Indigo.\\n\\n“Careful witch,” Indigo snapped, earning herself a glare from Scarlett.\\n\\n“I’m getting late Indy, I have to collect Elijah from the airport,” she said running down the steps, taking two at a time and skipping the last four. Her feet hitting the dark wooden floorboards with a thud.\\n\\n“Scarlett… calm down,” Jessica said stepping out of the mansion kitchen. She had an apron on and her black hair pulled into a messy bun. From the splashes of flour Scarlett noted she must have been working on another cake order. Despite being a werewolf, Jessica was a well-known and in-demand baker in Stratford-Upon-Avon. It was something that kept her busy and her mind off things.\\n\\nDespite being the Luna to the Blood Moon Pack, Jessica was not fully acknowledged by the pack members. It had been years since they had joined their pack - after the first Luna was killed in a rogue attack which had left the pack devastated. When Jessica had stepped into the broken alphas life the pack had mixed emotions, with some glad that their alpha would not go insane after the loss of his Luna and others uncertain if anyone could replace their alphas mate, finding her entering his life a disrespect to their previous Luna.\\n\\n“Make up your mind! Do you want me to hurry or not?” Scarlett said, not waiting for a reply as she rushed from the house crossing the green lawn and getting into her white Ford Fiesta.\\n\\nScarlett lived near the beautiful town of Stratford-Upon-Avon with woods surrounding their pack area. It was a small place but with plenty of open grounds, perfect for their pack - The Blood Moon. Most of the pack members lived in the pack area but some lived in the town amongst the humans and would come to the woods for a run or pack meetings.\\n\\nThe Alpha, Jackson Westwood, was her stepfather and owned the area. He had his own businesses that helped support the pack financially. Despite his pack only having around 500 members, he was still a strong and fair alpha.\\n\\nThe sun was high in the sky and she lowered her window slightly, putting some EDM music on. Tapping the steering wheel with her freshly painted nails. It was roughly a 50-minute drive to Birmingham, the closest airport to their town, and she was glad for the time to mentally prepare to see him again…\\n\\nSighing she lent back in her seat, Elijah Westwood. The son of her stepfather, the future Alpha of The Blood Moon Pack. She had not seen him for the last two years, it was two summers ago when he had visited from his extensive alpha training around the country, that was when she had realised she was crushing on her own stepbrother. The very thought made her internally cringe. A thought she would not dare utter aloud.\\n\\nShe felt nervous now, wondering if those feelings would be gone, she hoped so, not wanting things to become awkward between them. Although Elijah was not the nicest towards her, always teasing, taunting, or trying to embarrass her. She had been so glad when he first left town five years ago, thinking good riddance.\\n\\nBut when he had returned two summers ago, she had seen him completely differently. Now with his training complete, and returning home permanently, he would become alpha soon enough whilst Jackson would step down. She always knew Elijah was a very handsome young man. He had delicious chocolate locks with natural streaks lightened by the sun and those piercing blue eyes...\\n\\n“Fuck…” She muttered. Do not let yourself go down that train of thought Scarlett… Not now. Not ever.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe airport was a rush with people leaving and entering, taxis and cars parked all around. She struggled to find a parking space before squeezing herself into a very tight spot, then realising she could not open her side door. Groaning in frustration she climbed over to the passenger seat and got out. She had failed four tests before passing and bay parking was still not one of her strong points…\\n\\nEntering the airport she scanned the Flight Information Display. The flight had landed thirty minutes ago. She pouted crossing her arms, hoping she wasn’t too late. It did take time to collect your luggage, right?\\n\\n“Finally… Why am I not surprised?” A drawling voice came from behind her, she spun around knocking into someone.\\n\\n“Ouch fuck! That hurt!” Scarlett groaned. Massaging her breast she looked up to glare at the brick-like man she had just knocked into, freezing when she looked into her step-brother\\'s cocky face. The scent of winter spice, vanilla and white musk enveloped her senses.\\n\\n“Need some help massaging that?” He asked, his eyes flitting down to her breasts, she blushed glaring at him.\\n\\n“Oh shut up Elijah,” she replied rolling her eyes.\\n\\n“What\\'s wrong? Can’t big brother take care of his precious little sister?” He mocked. His words ignited a forbidden pleasure within her. “I promise to take good care of you… Just say the word Red…” His breath tickled her ear, her heart pounded in her chest.\\n\\nShe shoved him away from her, trying not to notice the way his chest felt under her fingers. He looked incredible, sexier than she remembered, had he grown a little more? Towering over six foot, he was definitely a lot bulkier than before. His skin was tanned and a light stubble covered his jaw. Dressed in ripped jeans, a white T-shirt, a leather jacket and Nike trainers he looked effortlessly good. He was the typical alpha male - drop-dead gorgeous.\\n\\n“Stop being an ass, it\\'s clear you haven\\'t changed.” She said glaring at him. He looked down at her, she smelt… delicious.\\n\\n“You’ve changed a lot though… I was beginning to think the Instagram posts may have all been photo-shopped and edited… clearly not…”He said, his eyes trailing over her 5-foot-2 frame and taking in her curves. She was on the smaller side for a she-wolf but he liked it. Trying not to linger on the way her black top stretched at the bust, paired with blue skinny jeans and black heels boots she looked effortlessly hot. She did not look like a young girl anymore - now grown into a hot sexy woman. (that much was for sure, he was not blind to deny that.) He wasn’t blind and no matter who she was, he couldn’t deny it.\\n\\n“If you\\'re done being annoying, shall we go? I don’t have all day.” She said leading the way out. Elijah smirked as he followed her, his eyes falling on her ass, she really did fill out nicely. Her Instagram only held selfies or food pictures. Summer was sure going to be fun…\\n\\nThey reached the car soon after and she unlocked it opening the boot for him, he tossed in his suitcase and duffel bag, walking around to the passenger seat.\\n\\n“Wait let me get in first,” she said. He raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n“What? Did you smash in the other door?”\\n\\n“No, the parking spot was tight.” She said, sliding in and over to the driver\\'s seat before he got in. A rich white floral scent filled the car, hers.\\n\\n“The parking spot was fine, you parked wrong.” He remarked as she started the car.\\n\\n“Buckle up,” Scarlett said ignoring his remark.\\n\\n“Worried for me?” He teased, smirking when she glared at him.\\n\\n“No, but it\\'s my car, so my rules.” She said reversing out of the spot, very aware of his observation. He ignored her refusing to put the belt on, fiddling with her playlist. Sitting back when ‘Or Nah’ by Somo began playing.\\n\\nShe kept her eyes on the road trying not to focus on the words of the song. The words a little too much, and with Elijah in the car… The image in her head was not a decent one…\\n\\n“So how come you were sent to get me?” He asked looking over at the feisty redhead.\\n\\n“Last minute meeting with some alpha popped up and you know dad, work comes first.” She replied, making Elijah frown. It irked him when she called his dad, ‘dad’.\\n\\n“Makes sense.” He said not letting his annoyance show.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you just run the rest of the way back?” She asked. Her wolf seemed to agree with her. Although having a wolf you did not have a second voice in your head, you could feel their emotions and sense their opinions. Like a second conscience.\\n\\n“Luggage darling,” he said tauntingly, earning a frown from the young woman. “What about Jessica, busy baking?”\\n\\n“Yep, I thought she didn’t have anything today but some last-minute order came in and like they say, what was the point of buying me a car if I can’t be of some use?”\\n\\nElijah smirked “I agree, freeloader.” He said poking the side of her head, making her glare at him once again.\\n\\n“I am not a freeloader, I help at the restaurant on weekends… and I\\'m working at a salon too…” She said, her glare fading. Unlike Elijah, the smart intelligent - pride of the family. She had been a disappointment, doing a beauty course in college she went on to apply at a local human salon. Something her parents had not been happy about, wanting her to get a degree like Elijah, who aside from his alpha duties had a business degree under his belt.\\n\\n“Cool. I like the hair, it suits you.” He said. Growing up she had gone from purples to blues, and pinks, but this was the reddest he had seen it and it looked pretty hot on her.\\n\\n“Thanks,” she replied suspiciously. “So are you hungry? Shall we stop at a service station?”\\n\\n“Yeah lets, I\\'m fucking starved, you know the food on the plane is not edible.” He said pushing his seat as far back as possible and stretching his long legs a little.\\n\\n“It isn\\'t so bad.” She said amused. She kept her eyes open for a sign that told them a service station was approaching.\\n\\nChapter 2 An Unexpected Visitor\\nIt was twenty minutes later, and both walked into the service station. Ordering some McDonalds, Elijah carried the tray to the table.\\n\\n“I can’t believe you can still eat four big macs…” She said, staring at his abs. He was an alpha after all and guess with all the working out he needed it.\\n\\n“I\\'m a big boy, Red, I need fuel.” He replied, as they took a seat opposite each other. She took her fish fillet meal and unwrapping her burger, looked across at him. Once again, her stomach did a flip when their eyes met.\\n\\n“Are you still single? Or have you found a man that can tame that temper of yours?” He asked, biting into his burger, thinking he doubted she was single; boys had always found her sexy and hot. But it was her feisty temper that never got them far. But looking at her now, there was no way she was single. And he knew she had not found her mate or there would have been a mark on her neck.\\n\\n“Very funny Elijah, how about you? Are you still a fuckboy or have you found your mate who can tame your wild ways?\" She asked, avoiding his question as she imitated the tone he had used. Knowing he hadn’t, or the entire pack would have known. Elijah smirked.\\n\\n“I like my wild ways... there are no rules when it comes to me.” He said, leaning forward as he winked at her. Her heart thudded in her chest.\\n\\n“What does that even mean?” she asked sipping her drink.\\n\\n“Figure it out, Red, figure it out…” Elijah said. His eyes fell on those red lips of hers, the way they wrapped around that straw… The way she licked her lips.\\n\\nHe frowned, what the fuck was his problem. She was his stepsister, and he was checking her out a little too much… He needed to get a woman tonight, release all the pent-up energy he seemed to have inside of him.\\n\\n“Wasn’t there a blood moon like a month ago?” He asked after a moment. For werewolves, they could only find their mate on a blood moon. Something that occurred two nights in a year. It was on these nights that the bond snapped into place, as long as your mate was nearby.\\n\\n“Yes, there was.” She said, curtly frowning at her burger. If she had found her mate, perhaps these stupid feelings would have gone away.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nThey were back on the road. With twenty minutes left before they got home. Elijah was bopping his knee to the music. Every now and then his gaze going to the feisty redhead in the driver\\'s seat. Her choppy red hair hiding half her face, as she moved her body to the music.\\n\\nSuddenly, he saw a blur flash past the car.\\n\\n“Watch out!” He shouted, grabbing the steering wheel, and jerking it to the left. Scarlett let out a startled scream as she was thrown into him.\\n\\nThe car flipped over as something big hit the car. A crunch of metal made Scarlett wince, feeling a painful ache in her waist until she felt a hand that sent pleasant tingles through her when he touched her there.\\n\\nFuck Red, you\\'re bleeding.” He murmured, receiving a groan of pain in response. “Hush I got you.”\\n\\nKicking the door off its hinges, he rolled out, cradling her body to his chest. Standing up, he looked at the three wolves that stood there growling. He could smell they weren\\'t rogues. Two were rather big, definitely a beta and a delta.\\n\\n“What do you want?” Elijah asked icily, moving Scarlett behind him defensively. His large body covering her much smaller one.\\n\\nThe largest wolf shifted into a young man. wearing nothing, and not even phased by it. Something that was normal with werewolves. He looked around 21. His sharp brown eyes met Elijah’s blue ones. A sharp wind blew past them, rustling the grass on the roadsides.\\n\\n“Her, leave her and you are welcome to pass.\" He said, Scarlett froze, why did they want her? Elijah raised an eyebrow\\n\\n“You’re talking to a fucking alpha. I don’t obey fucking orders. I give them.” He growled, his voice deepening.\\n\\nThe man raised his hand, stepping back.\\n\\n“I get that… but can I speak to her?” He asked tersely. Elijah growled again, ready to shift, but Scarlett placed a hand on his arm and stepped out from behind him.\\n\\n“Scarlett…” The man said, making her frown. “It’s Cade. You may not remember me, but I sure as hell can recognise those green eyes anywhere.”\\n\\nScarlett froze, her heart thumping. Cade. There was only one Cade she knew, and he should be a hundred miles away in her father’s pack. Her heart thumped in her chest. Elijah looked at her sharply. He could hear the thudding in her chest and smell the fear in the air.\\n\\nHe placed a hand instinctively around her waist, pulling her close, glaring at Cade threateningly.\\n\\n“Mates?” Cade asked, making Scarlett blush despite the seriousness of the situation.\\n\\n“Maybe,” Elijah growled, feeling a strong sense of possessiveness the way Cade was looking at her and talking to her. “Can someone share how the fuck you two know each other?”\\n\\n“He’s from my old pack.” Scarlett said quietly, very aware of every ridge of his body, her chest pressed against his. Elijah looked momentarily surprised.\\n\\n“And you need to return and take your place.” Cade said, watching them calmly, realising they did not smell the same. And from what he could see, neither was marked. “I\\'m the new beta, the beta that will take his place by your-”\\n\\n“Just leave! I don’t want anything to do with that pack! Now leave before I tear you all to pieces!\" She growled, her eyes flashing dangerously. Only Jackson knew her father was an alpha, despite all the rumours since the night of her first shift. But they had wanted to keep it a secret, the fact that her father had traced them this far... Meant he knew exactly where they were living.\\n\\nCade frowned, signalling to the two wolves by his side to attack. Scarlett turned ready to fight, a spasming pain ricocheting up her side but the wolves were aiming for Elijah. Who had shifted into a magnificent light brown wolf, his fur was glossy.\\n\\nHe was huge, bigger than before Scarlett thought in awe. He clearly stood over 5 feet in height on all fours, and he was larger than any alpha wolf Scarlett had seen before.\\n\\nHe lunged at the wolves before they even got to him, biting into one of their necks as he ripped it clean off the body. Blood splattered everywhere. His paw slashing through the other wolves chest.\\n\\nWhen the first wolf fell to the ground dead, shifting into the body of a decapitated human. Cade must have mind linked something to the second wolf, who quickly retreated. Elijah shifted to his human form, a strong aura surrounding him. His alpha power emanating from him.\\n\\n“Tell your alpha, there\\'s no fucking way he’s getting Scarlett. Whatever his reasons, try to attack or reach out to her one more time and I will take it as a personal attack. You don’t want to get on the wrong side of future Alpha Elijah Westwood of The Blood Moon Pack and we’re ready for war.\" He said his voice was dangerous and deep.\\n\\nCade frowned and nodded, casting one last glance at Scarlett.\\n\\n“You can’t run from your birthright...\" He mumbled before turning, shifting, and running off.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath, and it was then she realised that Elijah was stood ass naked in front of her. He turned, and she quickly closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Clothes!” She shrieked, Elijah raised an eyebrow, looking down.\\n\\n“What are you, a baby? Never seen a cock before?” He asked, thinking she had no problem with that other guy’s dick on show.\\n\\n“Of course I have. I just don’t want to be traumatised for life by seeing yours!” She said, wincing at the sting of pain in her side.\\n\\n“Whatever you say, Red, every woman would beg to get one look at mine.\" His cocky reply came.\\n\\n“I\\'m your sister, remember?\" She retorted, her eyes still averted, knowing if she looked, she would just have even more vivid images to dream over. He did not reply, flipping the wrecked car onto all fours and opening the boot. Taking out his duffel bag, he pulled on a pair of pants.\\n\\n“You can look now, prude.” He remarked, walking over to her as she rolled her eyes. Knowing she was hiding something. He had not missed how she had cut the guy off, or the fear that rolled off her. But now was not the time to ask. Reaching for the hem of her black top, he tore it off her, making her gasp.\\n\\n“What are you doing!” She shrieked, covering her breasts in the lacy red bra with her arms. Not that it covered much, he thought. She was a decent-sized cup, not huge and not small either. The perfect size for his hands, he thought, frowning as he pushed the thought away. She was his stepsister, he reminded himself. His eyes moved from her tempting breasts to her waist before he crouched down\\n\\n“It’ll heal, although it is pretty deep.” He said, about to touch it when she grabbed his arms. Glaring at him despite the very faint blush on her cheeks. He raised an eyebrow, smirking at her embarrassment, not knowing it was their close proximity that was getting to her. Taking her wrists, he held them against the car still crouching before her.\\n\\n“What are you doing?!” She yelped, her heart hammering. Was she dreaming? Her core throbbed and his rough move had only made matters worse.\\n\\n“It’ll heal quicker.\" He said huskily, he leaned in, not missing her thudding heart. And ran his tongue along the wound slowly. She gasped as pleasure erupted through her. Her eye lids fluttered shut, her core aching with pleasure. As his tongue slowly ran up her hip, across her waist, and stopped just below her breast.\\n\\nHe inhaled her tempting scent, the feel of her skin and the sweet taste of her blood. Alpha saliva had healing abilities, although more so in wolf form. He knew she would have healed soon enough, but seeing her there in her bra had awakened something inside him, and he had wanted to feel her smooth skin against his lips...\\n\\nHe looked up, past her perfect mounds. Not missing the hardened buds, which sent blood rushing down south. Slowly shifting his gaze to her flushed face, just as their eyes met, the scent of her arousal hit him like an intoxicating avalanche…\\n\\nChapter 3 Bubble Butt\\nCerulean blue eyes met sage green. Scarlett’s heart thundered in her chest as Elijah stood up slowly, his gaze shifting to her red tempting lips. He licked his plush lips slowly and she did not miss the piercing on his tongue making her eyes widen slightly. He forced his gaze away, trying not to get lost in the scent of her arousal. What the fuck were they doing?\\n\\nHe looked at the car, his back now to her, two tyres were flat and there was no way they were going to be driving it home.\\n\\n“Shift… we’ll have to run, I’ll mind link someone to collect the car and stuff.” He said trying not to look at her.\\n\\n“Um sure..” Her reply came, sounding rather normal despite the crazy storm in her head. ‘Fuck! He smelt my arousal! No wonder he’s not even looking at me!’ she thought frustrated. She did not really want to shift but there really was no other option.\\n\\nThey both shifted and Elijah once again looked at her in surprise, it was not only her stunning grey-white fur that stood out, but she was big - over 4 and a half foot tall. That was the size of an average alpha. She saw his curious gaze.\\n\\n\\'How the fuck are you so big?\\' He asked through the mind link.\\n\\n\\'Luck?\\' came her not so helpful reply as she broke into a run and ran towards home as fast as possible. He gave a wolfish grin, his wolf enjoying the thought of playing chase with a female. He ran after her, impressed with her speed, as he followed keeping up with her he had to quicken his own pace. It was not like chasing a normal wolf, that was something an alpha wolf could do with ease…\\n\\nHe nipped playfully at her as he brushed past her, causing her to slow down for a fraction of a second making him chuckle in his head.\\n\\n\\'What happened Red?\\' He teased.\\n\\n\\'Don’t mess with me Elijah!\\' She retorted, lunging at his back, wincing as her side made impact with him. He grunted as he stumbled tossing her wolf off him, she grabbed on to his neck with her jaw and both tumbled down the hill, laughing in their heads.\\n\\n\\'Foul play there sweetheart!\\' His mocking voice came, making her heart pound and core throb once more.\\n\\n\\'All’s fair in love and war, and this is war!\\' She replied through the link as he licked her face, making her growl.\\n\\n“Are you two done?” A male voice came laughing heartily. Both wolves looked up to see they had reached pack borders and none other than the alpha stood there. The wolves sprang away from each other as if caught doing something wrong, something that only crossed both of their minds and no one else\\'s.\\n\\nJackson smiled down at his son. “Welcome home son.”\\n\\n\\'Glad to be back.\\' Elijah replied as one of the wolves accompanying the alpha tossed them both some clothes. Both took them in their mouths and went to change behind some trees.\\n\\nScarlett’s heart was pounding, what had happened? Elijah had never been so… playful. Pulling on the black baggy tee that fell to mid-thigh she stepped out from behind the tree, her side still aching, although the bleeding had lessened. Being an alpha blooded she-wolf she healed faster than the normal wolf and she was sure Elijah had helped… A blush faintly dusted her cheek, but she schooled her face into passiveness before she walked over to where Elijah was hugging his father. Although both men were over six foot, Elijah was clearly the bigger one.\\n\\n“Ah, there you are? What happened to the car?” Jackson asked placing an arm around Scarlett’s shoulder once he moved back from Elijah.\\n\\n“We were ambushed.” Elijah said glancing at Scarlett who had tensed.\\n\\n“Rogues?” Jackson said with a frown.\\n\\n“Yes!” Scarlett said quickly, making both alpha’s look at her. Elijah raised an eyebrow questioningly.\\n\\n\\'What the fuck do you mean yes?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not now… please I’ll explain later\\' she pleaded through the link.\\n\\n“Hmm, it\\'s strange that there are rogues out so close to the pack borders…” Jackson said seriously.\\n\\n“Just a stray lone wolf, don’t stress it, I got Hank to get the car and stuff.” Elijah said, Jackson nodded.\\n\\n“That’s my son.” He said then looked at Scarlett, “Now how about we go home, your mother has definitely cooked a five-course meal.”\\n\\n“You know her dad, she loves the kitchen.” Scarlett said as Jackson kissed her forehead tenderly. Elijah watched the exchange with slight annoyance. He never understood why his father had to treat the girls as his own daughters… Although he knew he was being biased considering he treated Indigo like his little sister.\\n\\nSpeaking of the pixie…\\n\\n“Elijahhh!” She shrieked lunging onto Elijah’s bare back and kissing his cheek. “You’re home!!!”\\n\\n“Yeah, and I’ll probably be deaf if you continue to scream in my ear!” He said as he cupped her behind her knees carrying her piggyback style.\\n\\n“Oh, it\\'s ok I\\'m sure you’ll still be loved even if you do go deaf.” Indigo replied as Scarlett looked back at them. “Hey witch, why do you have blood dripping down your leg?”\\n\\nAll eyes went to Scarlett’s legs, although Elijah’s gaze had gone to her inner thighs first before realising blood was dripping down from her waist.\\n\\n“Oh, I hurt it a little, I\\'m fine.” Scarlett said as Jackson looked very concerned.\\n\\n“Oh no dear, this is not good, Elijah couldn\\'t you protect your sister?” He said worriedly scooping her up bridal style, making Elijah frown and Indigo roll her eyes.\\n\\n“Daddy’s girl.” She muttered as Jackson hurriedly broke into a run.\\n\\n“I\\'m fine dad, really!” Scarlett protested, as they made their way down the winding path and through the trees. The slightly cloudy skies could be seen through the treetops.\\n\\n“Attention seeker.” Elijah retorted. The two really annoyed him, he hated their relationship. He stalked past them with indigo on his back as she stuck her tongue out at Scarlett.\\n\\n“Ignore them, Elijah she’s just a spoilt brat.” She said making Scarlett frown and Elijah nod in agreement before they both ran off towards home.\\n\\nJackson shook his head as a sharp wind blew, messing up both their hair, making Scarlett blow a few strands of hers out of her face.\\n\\n“Ignore them two.” He said knowing they always picked on her. “Although I thought you and Elijah may have been putting your differences aside but seems not.”\\n\\n“That won’t ever happen.” Scarlett huffed as they walked through the green fields approaching the woods that surrounded the small pack village area. Jackson chuckled as he agreed reluctantly.\\n\\n“Siblings. What can I say? You’re both headstrong.”\\n\\nScarlett didn’t reply feeling a sense of guilt filling her, she didn’t think of her stepbrother in a brotherly way at all…\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt was later in the evening and after getting her checked by the pack doctor Jackson had bought her home. She had showered, donning a pair of black leggings and a V neck purple tee. The smell of freshly cooked chicken, roasted potatoes, southern fried chicken strips, stuffed peppers, and lasagne wafted into her room. She loved her mother’s cooking. It always felt nice when the weather changed for the worse. It was pouring down outside unlike the clear sky earlier. The joys of British weather she thought morbidly. She did like the rain as long as she was inside but going out in it wasn’t the most enjoyable thing.\\n\\nShe heard the creak of the wooden floorboards outside her room and knew someone was going down the hall, the downside of a traditional style house. It was a large house, the largest in the territory, with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, an office, 2 lounges, game room, a gym room in the basement, kitchen and a dining room. It was a nice old English style brick building with dark-framed windows.\\n\\n“Oi Scar! Come make your mighty presence known at Simba’s coronation!” Indigo shouted. Scarlett closed her eyes and sighed pinching the bridge of her nose.\\n\\n“Shut the hell up Indy!” She snapped back, hating the nicknames her sister had for her.\\n\\n“You know if you got hurt on your face today you would have looked even more like Scar….” Indy’s voice came giggling as she ran off down the hall.\\n\\nScarlett exited her room after donning a pair of black block heels. She didn’t like walking barefoot in the house. Indy simply said it was because she was a midget. Maybe it was true, she felt a little short for werewolf standards…\\n\\nShe walked down the steps, her fingers brushing the dark wooden balcony rail, stopping in her tracks when she saw the front door open. A strong draft of cold air entering the warm house, accompanied by the smell of wet earth and the sweet scent of Fiona Williamson. The girl was stood leaning against the door frame, wearing a white leather skirt, a pale pink peplum blouse and a white leather jacket. Her long tan legs on show, she was a stunning twenty-one-year-old. Scarlett had to admit it with her 5,8 height, long brown waves, and those big hazel eyes...\\n\\nElijah was looking down at her with a smirk on his face, clearly flirting, Scarlett felt a pang of jealousy go through her as she frowned slightly averting her gaze and stalked towards the kitchen.\\n\\n“Oh hey Scarlett.” Fiona said smiling sweetly, stopping Scarlett in her tracks. Elijah turned his gaze falling to her perfect peach, thinking fuck did she have to wear such skimpy clothing… the leggings stuck to her like a second skin shaping her ass so fucking sexily. He was not used to seeing her look this good.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath before plastering a smile on her face and turned.\\n\\n“Oh hey Fiona, I didn’t see you there.” She said making Elijah raise an eyebrow.\\n\\n“Really? She’s hard to miss Red… looking this gorgeous anyway…”He added making Fiona blush and pat his chest playfully, Scarlett rolled her eyes.\\n\\n“I know, she really is, but it’s your big fat ass that blocked my entire view.” She retorted making Fiona smile.\\n\\n“This ass is far from fat wouldn’t you agree Fiona?”He said playing with a strand of her long brown hair.\\n\\n“Definitely anything but fat…” She said blushing.\\n\\n“Awe how cute! Well as much as I would love to stay and chat - I really don’t want to discuss Elijah’s ass. Plus I’m really hungry.” Scarlett said crossing her arms, only making Elijah’s eyes fall to her breasts for a split second.\\n\\nFiona laughed “Then I won’t keep you, nice seeing you Scarlett.”\\n\\n“Mm..” Scarlett replied.\\n\\n“Yeah, you should go eat, that ass is definitely not all muscle.” He snickered, making Scarlett turn and glare at him before she stormed off into the kitchen that was glowing welcomingly.\\n\\n“Be nice to her Elijah.” Fiona said in a flirtier tone, “So… I’ll see you tonight?”\\n\\n“Sure… See you tonight, leave your window open.” He whispered into her ear, kissing her jaw before stepping away. Fiona nodded before she walked off swaying her hips on purpose. Elijah glanced at her, thinking she had a fine ass but there was something about Scarlett’s sexy bubble butt that made him hard just thinking about it. He glanced down at the front of his pants, adjusting them, and thinking he really needed to meet Fiona tonight…\\n————————————\\n💋Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here\\nInstall the APP to search for the book title 👉\"Her Forbidden Alpha\" 👈Read more exciting content immediately.', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n😘 Install APP to read more 👉👉Her Forbidden Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:55:31', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world.\\n————————————————————\\nChapter 1 Homecoming\\n“Scarlett! Please hurry up I don’t want your brother having to wait so long!” Jessica shouted up the stairs to her daughter.\\n\\n“Kk Mama! I know, relax!” She called back.\\n\\nScarlett rolled her eyes applying her trademark red lipstick. If you got it why not flaunt it? She thought to herself as she stared in the mirror at her reflection. Staring back at her was a beautiful young woman with strawberry choppy shoulder-length hair which was dyed in an ombre style, the bottom half a vivid red. Plumping up her hair she stood up and grabbed her car keys. She loved being eighteen - having received her car from her mother and stepfather on her birthday a few months ago.\\n\\nDespite turning 18, the age that most young werewolves found their mates, Scarlett had not. She didn’t worry too much about it, after all, their pack wasn’t too big and her mate could be anywhere in the world. For now, she’d simply focus on herself. She had felt her wolf awaken, felt her presence in her mind and had shifted to a magnificent grey wolf. It had been bigger than most wolves in their town, something that had caused rumours to spread around the town, no one knew her mother\\'s mate had been an alpha. But her wolf had been a dead giveaway to that.\\n\\nShe rushed out of her room almost bumping into her fourteen-year-old sister Indigo.\\n\\n“Careful witch,” Indigo snapped, earning herself a glare from Scarlett.\\n\\n“I’m getting late Indy, I have to collect Elijah from the airport,” she said running down the steps, taking two at a time and skipping the last four. Her feet hitting the dark wooden floorboards with a thud.\\n\\n“Scarlett… calm down,” Jessica said stepping out of the mansion kitchen. She had an apron on and her black hair pulled into a messy bun. From the splashes of flour Scarlett noted she must have been working on another cake order. Despite being a werewolf, Jessica was a well-known and in-demand baker in Stratford-Upon-Avon. It was something that kept her busy and her mind off things.\\n\\nDespite being the Luna to the Blood Moon Pack, Jessica was not fully acknowledged by the pack members. It had been years since they had joined their pack - after the first Luna was killed in a rogue attack which had left the pack devastated. When Jessica had stepped into the broken alphas life the pack had mixed emotions, with some glad that their alpha would not go insane after the loss of his Luna and others uncertain if anyone could replace their alphas mate, finding her entering his life a disrespect to their previous Luna.\\n\\n“Make up your mind! Do you want me to hurry or not?” Scarlett said, not waiting for a reply as she rushed from the house crossing the green lawn and getting into her white Ford Fiesta.\\n\\nScarlett lived near the beautiful town of Stratford-Upon-Avon with woods surrounding their pack area. It was a small place but with plenty of open grounds, perfect for their pack - The Blood Moon. Most of the pack members lived in the pack area but some lived in the town amongst the humans and would come to the woods for a run or pack meetings.\\n\\nThe Alpha, Jackson Westwood, was her stepfather and owned the area. He had his own businesses that helped support the pack financially. Despite his pack only having around 500 members, he was still a strong and fair alpha.\\n\\nThe sun was high in the sky and she lowered her window slightly, putting some EDM music on. Tapping the steering wheel with her freshly painted nails. It was roughly a 50-minute drive to Birmingham, the closest airport to their town, and she was glad for the time to mentally prepare to see him again…\\n\\nSighing she lent back in her seat, Elijah Westwood. The son of her stepfather, the future Alpha of The Blood Moon Pack. She had not seen him for the last two years, it was two summers ago when he had visited from his extensive alpha training around the country, that was when she had realised she was crushing on her own stepbrother. The very thought made her internally cringe. A thought she would not dare utter aloud.\\n\\nShe felt nervous now, wondering if those feelings would be gone, she hoped so, not wanting things to become awkward between them. Although Elijah was not the nicest towards her, always teasing, taunting, or trying to embarrass her. She had been so glad when he first left town five years ago, thinking good riddance.\\n\\nBut when he had returned two summers ago, she had seen him completely differently. Now with his training complete, and returning home permanently, he would become alpha soon enough whilst Jackson would step down. She always knew Elijah was a very handsome young man. He had delicious chocolate locks with natural streaks lightened by the sun and those piercing blue eyes...\\n\\n“Fuck…” She muttered. Do not let yourself go down that train of thought Scarlett… Not now. Not ever.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe airport was a rush with people leaving and entering, taxis and cars parked all around. She struggled to find a parking space before squeezing herself into a very tight spot, then realising she could not open her side door. Groaning in frustration she climbed over to the passenger seat and got out. She had failed four tests before passing and bay parking was still not one of her strong points…\\n\\nEntering the airport she scanned the Flight Information Display. The flight had landed thirty minutes ago. She pouted crossing her arms, hoping she wasn’t too late. It did take time to collect your luggage, right?\\n\\n“Finally… Why am I not surprised?” A drawling voice came from behind her, she spun around knocking into someone.\\n\\n“Ouch fuck! That hurt!” Scarlett groaned. Massaging her breast she looked up to glare at the brick-like man she had just knocked into, freezing when she looked into her step-brother\\'s cocky face. The scent of winter spice, vanilla and white musk enveloped her senses.\\n\\n“Need some help massaging that?” He asked, his eyes flitting down to her breasts, she blushed glaring at him.\\n\\n“Oh shut up Elijah,” she replied rolling her eyes.\\n\\n“What\\'s wrong? Can’t big brother take care of his precious little sister?” He mocked. His words ignited a forbidden pleasure within her. “I promise to take good care of you… Just say the word Red…” His breath tickled her ear, her heart pounded in her chest.\\n\\nShe shoved him away from her, trying not to notice the way his chest felt under her fingers. He looked incredible, sexier than she remembered, had he grown a little more? Towering over six foot, he was definitely a lot bulkier than before. His skin was tanned and a light stubble covered his jaw. Dressed in ripped jeans, a white T-shirt, a leather jacket and Nike trainers he looked effortlessly good. He was the typical alpha male - drop-dead gorgeous.\\n\\n“Stop being an ass, it\\'s clear you haven\\'t changed.” She said glaring at him. He looked down at her, she smelt… delicious.\\n\\n“You’ve changed a lot though… I was beginning to think the Instagram posts may have all been photo-shopped and edited… clearly not…”He said, his eyes trailing over her 5-foot-2 frame and taking in her curves. She was on the smaller side for a she-wolf but he liked it. Trying not to linger on the way her black top stretched at the bust, paired with blue skinny jeans and black heels boots she looked effortlessly hot. She did not look like a young girl anymore - now grown into a hot sexy woman. (that much was for sure, he was not blind to deny that.) He wasn’t blind and no matter who she was, he couldn’t deny it.\\n\\n“If you\\'re done being annoying, shall we go? I don’t have all day.” She said leading the way out. Elijah smirked as he followed her, his eyes falling on her ass, she really did fill out nicely. Her Instagram only held selfies or food pictures. Summer was sure going to be fun…\\n\\nThey reached the car soon after and she unlocked it opening the boot for him, he tossed in his suitcase and duffel bag, walking around to the passenger seat.\\n\\n“Wait let me get in first,” she said. He raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n“What? Did you smash in the other door?”\\n\\n“No, the parking spot was tight.” She said, sliding in and over to the driver\\'s seat before he got in. A rich white floral scent filled the car, hers.\\n\\n“The parking spot was fine, you parked wrong.” He remarked as she started the car.\\n\\n“Buckle up,” Scarlett said ignoring his remark.\\n\\n“Worried for me?” He teased, smirking when she glared at him.\\n\\n“No, but it\\'s my car, so my rules.” She said reversing out of the spot, very aware of his observation. He ignored her refusing to put the belt on, fiddling with her playlist. Sitting back when ‘Or Nah’ by Somo began playing.\\n\\nShe kept her eyes on the road trying not to focus on the words of the song. The words a little too much, and with Elijah in the car… The image in her head was not a decent one…\\n\\n“So how come you were sent to get me?” He asked looking over at the feisty redhead.\\n\\n“Last minute meeting with some alpha popped up and you know dad, work comes first.” She replied, making Elijah frown. It irked him when she called his dad, ‘dad’.\\n\\n“Makes sense.” He said not letting his annoyance show.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you just run the rest of the way back?” She asked. Her wolf seemed to agree with her. Although having a wolf you did not have a second voice in your head, you could feel their emotions and sense their opinions. Like a second conscience.\\n\\n“Luggage darling,” he said tauntingly, earning a frown from the young woman. “What about Jessica, busy baking?”\\n\\n“Yep, I thought she didn’t have anything today but some last-minute order came in and like they say, what was the point of buying me a car if I can’t be of some use?”\\n\\nElijah smirked “I agree, freeloader.” He said poking the side of her head, making her glare at him once again.\\n\\n“I am not a freeloader, I help at the restaurant on weekends… and I\\'m working at a salon too…” She said, her glare fading. Unlike Elijah, the smart intelligent - pride of the family. She had been a disappointment, doing a beauty course in college she went on to apply at a local human salon. Something her parents had not been happy about, wanting her to get a degree like Elijah, who aside from his alpha duties had a business degree under his belt.\\n\\n“Cool. I like the hair, it suits you.” He said. Growing up she had gone from purples to blues, and pinks, but this was the reddest he had seen it and it looked pretty hot on her.\\n\\n“Thanks,” she replied suspiciously. “So are you hungry? Shall we stop at a service station?”\\n\\n“Yeah lets, I\\'m fucking starved, you know the food on the plane is not edible.” He said pushing his seat as far back as possible and stretching his long legs a little.\\n\\n“It isn\\'t so bad.” She said amused. She kept her eyes open for a sign that told them a service station was approaching.\\n\\nChapter 2 An Unexpected Visitor\\nIt was twenty minutes later, and both walked into the service station. Ordering some McDonalds, Elijah carried the tray to the table.\\n\\n“I can’t believe you can still eat four big macs…” She said, staring at his abs. He was an alpha after all and guess with all the working out he needed it.\\n\\n“I\\'m a big boy, Red, I need fuel.” He replied, as they took a seat opposite each other. She took her fish fillet meal and unwrapping her burger, looked across at him. Once again, her stomach did a flip when their eyes met.\\n\\n“Are you still single? Or have you found a man that can tame that temper of yours?” He asked, biting into his burger, thinking he doubted she was single; boys had always found her sexy and hot. But it was her feisty temper that never got them far. But looking at her now, there was no way she was single. And he knew she had not found her mate or there would have been a mark on her neck.\\n\\n“Very funny Elijah, how about you? Are you still a fuckboy or have you found your mate who can tame your wild ways?\" She asked, avoiding his question as she imitated the tone he had used. Knowing he hadn’t, or the entire pack would have known. Elijah smirked.\\n\\n“I like my wild ways... there are no rules when it comes to me.” He said, leaning forward as he winked at her. Her heart thudded in her chest.\\n\\n“What does that even mean?” she asked sipping her drink.\\n\\n“Figure it out, Red, figure it out…” Elijah said. His eyes fell on those red lips of hers, the way they wrapped around that straw… The way she licked her lips.\\n\\nHe frowned, what the fuck was his problem. She was his stepsister, and he was checking her out a little too much… He needed to get a woman tonight, release all the pent-up energy he seemed to have inside of him.\\n\\n“Wasn’t there a blood moon like a month ago?” He asked after a moment. For werewolves, they could only find their mate on a blood moon. Something that occurred two nights in a year. It was on these nights that the bond snapped into place, as long as your mate was nearby.\\n\\n“Yes, there was.” She said, curtly frowning at her burger. If she had found her mate, perhaps these stupid feelings would have gone away.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nThey were back on the road. With twenty minutes left before they got home. Elijah was bopping his knee to the music. Every now and then his gaze going to the feisty redhead in the driver\\'s seat. Her choppy red hair hiding half her face, as she moved her body to the music.\\n\\nSuddenly, he saw a blur flash past the car.\\n\\n“Watch out!” He shouted, grabbing the steering wheel, and jerking it to the left. Scarlett let out a startled scream as she was thrown into him.\\n\\nThe car flipped over as something big hit the car. A crunch of metal made Scarlett wince, feeling a painful ache in her waist until she felt a hand that sent pleasant tingles through her when he touched her there.\\n\\nFuck Red, you\\'re bleeding.” He murmured, receiving a groan of pain in response. “Hush I got you.”\\n\\nKicking the door off its hinges, he rolled out, cradling her body to his chest. Standing up, he looked at the three wolves that stood there growling. He could smell they weren\\'t rogues. Two were rather big, definitely a beta and a delta.\\n\\n“What do you want?” Elijah asked icily, moving Scarlett behind him defensively. His large body covering her much smaller one.\\n\\nThe largest wolf shifted into a young man. wearing nothing, and not even phased by it. Something that was normal with werewolves. He looked around 21. His sharp brown eyes met Elijah’s blue ones. A sharp wind blew past them, rustling the grass on the roadsides.\\n\\n“Her, leave her and you are welcome to pass.\" He said, Scarlett froze, why did they want her? Elijah raised an eyebrow\\n\\n“You’re talking to a fucking alpha. I don’t obey fucking orders. I give them.” He growled, his voice deepening.\\n\\nThe man raised his hand, stepping back.\\n\\n“I get that… but can I speak to her?” He asked tersely. Elijah growled again, ready to shift, but Scarlett placed a hand on his arm and stepped out from behind him.\\n\\n“Scarlett…” The man said, making her frown. “It’s Cade. You may not remember me, but I sure as hell can recognise those green eyes anywhere.”\\n\\nScarlett froze, her heart thumping. Cade. There was only one Cade she knew, and he should be a hundred miles away in her father’s pack. Her heart thumped in her chest. Elijah looked at her sharply. He could hear the thudding in her chest and smell the fear in the air.\\n\\nHe placed a hand instinctively around her waist, pulling her close, glaring at Cade threateningly.\\n\\n“Mates?” Cade asked, making Scarlett blush despite the seriousness of the situation.\\n\\n“Maybe,” Elijah growled, feeling a strong sense of possessiveness the way Cade was looking at her and talking to her. “Can someone share how the fuck you two know each other?”\\n\\n“He’s from my old pack.” Scarlett said quietly, very aware of every ridge of his body, her chest pressed against his. Elijah looked momentarily surprised.\\n\\n“And you need to return and take your place.” Cade said, watching them calmly, realising they did not smell the same. And from what he could see, neither was marked. “I\\'m the new beta, the beta that will take his place by your-”\\n\\n“Just leave! I don’t want anything to do with that pack! Now leave before I tear you all to pieces!\" She growled, her eyes flashing dangerously. Only Jackson knew her father was an alpha, despite all the rumours since the night of her first shift. But they had wanted to keep it a secret, the fact that her father had traced them this far... Meant he knew exactly where they were living.\\n\\nCade frowned, signalling to the two wolves by his side to attack. Scarlett turned ready to fight, a spasming pain ricocheting up her side but the wolves were aiming for Elijah. Who had shifted into a magnificent light brown wolf, his fur was glossy.\\n\\nHe was huge, bigger than before Scarlett thought in awe. He clearly stood over 5 feet in height on all fours, and he was larger than any alpha wolf Scarlett had seen before.\\n\\nHe lunged at the wolves before they even got to him, biting into one of their necks as he ripped it clean off the body. Blood splattered everywhere. His paw slashing through the other wolves chest.\\n\\nWhen the first wolf fell to the ground dead, shifting into the body of a decapitated human. Cade must have mind linked something to the second wolf, who quickly retreated. Elijah shifted to his human form, a strong aura surrounding him. His alpha power emanating from him.\\n\\n“Tell your alpha, there\\'s no fucking way he’s getting Scarlett. Whatever his reasons, try to attack or reach out to her one more time and I will take it as a personal attack. You don’t want to get on the wrong side of future Alpha Elijah Westwood of The Blood Moon Pack and we’re ready for war.\" He said his voice was dangerous and deep.\\n\\nCade frowned and nodded, casting one last glance at Scarlett.\\n\\n“You can’t run from your birthright...\" He mumbled before turning, shifting, and running off.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath, and it was then she realised that Elijah was stood ass naked in front of her. He turned, and she quickly closed her eyes.\\n\\n“Clothes!” She shrieked, Elijah raised an eyebrow, looking down.\\n\\n“What are you, a baby? Never seen a cock before?” He asked, thinking she had no problem with that other guy’s dick on show.\\n\\n“Of course I have. I just don’t want to be traumatised for life by seeing yours!” She said, wincing at the sting of pain in her side.\\n\\n“Whatever you say, Red, every woman would beg to get one look at mine.\" His cocky reply came.\\n\\n“I\\'m your sister, remember?\" She retorted, her eyes still averted, knowing if she looked, she would just have even more vivid images to dream over. He did not reply, flipping the wrecked car onto all fours and opening the boot. Taking out his duffel bag, he pulled on a pair of pants.\\n\\n“You can look now, prude.” He remarked, walking over to her as she rolled her eyes. Knowing she was hiding something. He had not missed how she had cut the guy off, or the fear that rolled off her. But now was not the time to ask. Reaching for the hem of her black top, he tore it off her, making her gasp.\\n\\n“What are you doing!” She shrieked, covering her breasts in the lacy red bra with her arms. Not that it covered much, he thought. She was a decent-sized cup, not huge and not small either. The perfect size for his hands, he thought, frowning as he pushed the thought away. She was his stepsister, he reminded himself. His eyes moved from her tempting breasts to her waist before he crouched down\\n\\n“It’ll heal, although it is pretty deep.” He said, about to touch it when she grabbed his arms. Glaring at him despite the very faint blush on her cheeks. He raised an eyebrow, smirking at her embarrassment, not knowing it was their close proximity that was getting to her. Taking her wrists, he held them against the car still crouching before her.\\n\\n“What are you doing?!” She yelped, her heart hammering. Was she dreaming? Her core throbbed and his rough move had only made matters worse.\\n\\n“It’ll heal quicker.\" He said huskily, he leaned in, not missing her thudding heart. And ran his tongue along the wound slowly. She gasped as pleasure erupted through her. Her eye lids fluttered shut, her core aching with pleasure. As his tongue slowly ran up her hip, across her waist, and stopped just below her breast.\\n\\nHe inhaled her tempting scent, the feel of her skin and the sweet taste of her blood. Alpha saliva had healing abilities, although more so in wolf form. He knew she would have healed soon enough, but seeing her there in her bra had awakened something inside him, and he had wanted to feel her smooth skin against his lips...\\n\\nHe looked up, past her perfect mounds. Not missing the hardened buds, which sent blood rushing down south. Slowly shifting his gaze to her flushed face, just as their eyes met, the scent of her arousal hit him like an intoxicating avalanche…\\n\\nChapter 3 Bubble Butt\\nCerulean blue eyes met sage green. Scarlett’s heart thundered in her chest as Elijah stood up slowly, his gaze shifting to her red tempting lips. He licked his plush lips slowly and she did not miss the piercing on his tongue making her eyes widen slightly. He forced his gaze away, trying not to get lost in the scent of her arousal. What the fuck were they doing?\\n\\nHe looked at the car, his back now to her, two tyres were flat and there was no way they were going to be driving it home.\\n\\n“Shift… we’ll have to run, I’ll mind link someone to collect the car and stuff.” He said trying not to look at her.\\n\\n“Um sure..” Her reply came, sounding rather normal despite the crazy storm in her head. ‘Fuck! He smelt my arousal! No wonder he’s not even looking at me!’ she thought frustrated. She did not really want to shift but there really was no other option.\\n\\nThey both shifted and Elijah once again looked at her in surprise, it was not only her stunning grey-white fur that stood out, but she was big - over 4 and a half foot tall. That was the size of an average alpha. She saw his curious gaze.\\n\\n\\'How the fuck are you so big?\\' He asked through the mind link.\\n\\n\\'Luck?\\' came her not so helpful reply as she broke into a run and ran towards home as fast as possible. He gave a wolfish grin, his wolf enjoying the thought of playing chase with a female. He ran after her, impressed with her speed, as he followed keeping up with her he had to quicken his own pace. It was not like chasing a normal wolf, that was something an alpha wolf could do with ease…\\n\\nHe nipped playfully at her as he brushed past her, causing her to slow down for a fraction of a second making him chuckle in his head.\\n\\n\\'What happened Red?\\' He teased.\\n\\n\\'Don’t mess with me Elijah!\\' She retorted, lunging at his back, wincing as her side made impact with him. He grunted as he stumbled tossing her wolf off him, she grabbed on to his neck with her jaw and both tumbled down the hill, laughing in their heads.\\n\\n\\'Foul play there sweetheart!\\' His mocking voice came, making her heart pound and core throb once more.\\n\\n\\'All’s fair in love and war, and this is war!\\' She replied through the link as he licked her face, making her growl.\\n\\n“Are you two done?” A male voice came laughing heartily. Both wolves looked up to see they had reached pack borders and none other than the alpha stood there. The wolves sprang away from each other as if caught doing something wrong, something that only crossed both of their minds and no one else\\'s.\\n\\nJackson smiled down at his son. “Welcome home son.”\\n\\n\\'Glad to be back.\\' Elijah replied as one of the wolves accompanying the alpha tossed them both some clothes. Both took them in their mouths and went to change behind some trees.\\n\\nScarlett’s heart was pounding, what had happened? Elijah had never been so… playful. Pulling on the black baggy tee that fell to mid-thigh she stepped out from behind the tree, her side still aching, although the bleeding had lessened. Being an alpha blooded she-wolf she healed faster than the normal wolf and she was sure Elijah had helped… A blush faintly dusted her cheek, but she schooled her face into passiveness before she walked over to where Elijah was hugging his father. Although both men were over six foot, Elijah was clearly the bigger one.\\n\\n“Ah, there you are? What happened to the car?” Jackson asked placing an arm around Scarlett’s shoulder once he moved back from Elijah.\\n\\n“We were ambushed.” Elijah said glancing at Scarlett who had tensed.\\n\\n“Rogues?” Jackson said with a frown.\\n\\n“Yes!” Scarlett said quickly, making both alpha’s look at her. Elijah raised an eyebrow questioningly.\\n\\n\\'What the fuck do you mean yes?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not now… please I’ll explain later\\' she pleaded through the link.\\n\\n“Hmm, it\\'s strange that there are rogues out so close to the pack borders…” Jackson said seriously.\\n\\n“Just a stray lone wolf, don’t stress it, I got Hank to get the car and stuff.” Elijah said, Jackson nodded.\\n\\n“That’s my son.” He said then looked at Scarlett, “Now how about we go home, your mother has definitely cooked a five-course meal.”\\n\\n“You know her dad, she loves the kitchen.” Scarlett said as Jackson kissed her forehead tenderly. Elijah watched the exchange with slight annoyance. He never understood why his father had to treat the girls as his own daughters… Although he knew he was being biased considering he treated Indigo like his little sister.\\n\\nSpeaking of the pixie…\\n\\n“Elijahhh!” She shrieked lunging onto Elijah’s bare back and kissing his cheek. “You’re home!!!”\\n\\n“Yeah, and I’ll probably be deaf if you continue to scream in my ear!” He said as he cupped her behind her knees carrying her piggyback style.\\n\\n“Oh, it\\'s ok I\\'m sure you’ll still be loved even if you do go deaf.” Indigo replied as Scarlett looked back at them. “Hey witch, why do you have blood dripping down your leg?”\\n\\nAll eyes went to Scarlett’s legs, although Elijah’s gaze had gone to her inner thighs first before realising blood was dripping down from her waist.\\n\\n“Oh, I hurt it a little, I\\'m fine.” Scarlett said as Jackson looked very concerned.\\n\\n“Oh no dear, this is not good, Elijah couldn\\'t you protect your sister?” He said worriedly scooping her up bridal style, making Elijah frown and Indigo roll her eyes.\\n\\n“Daddy’s girl.” She muttered as Jackson hurriedly broke into a run.\\n\\n“I\\'m fine dad, really!” Scarlett protested, as they made their way down the winding path and through the trees. The slightly cloudy skies could be seen through the treetops.\\n\\n“Attention seeker.” Elijah retorted. The two really annoyed him, he hated their relationship. He stalked past them with indigo on his back as she stuck her tongue out at Scarlett.\\n\\n“Ignore them, Elijah she’s just a spoilt brat.” She said making Scarlett frown and Elijah nod in agreement before they both ran off towards home.\\n\\nJackson shook his head as a sharp wind blew, messing up both their hair, making Scarlett blow a few strands of hers out of her face.\\n\\n“Ignore them two.” He said knowing they always picked on her. “Although I thought you and Elijah may have been putting your differences aside but seems not.”\\n\\n“That won’t ever happen.” Scarlett huffed as they walked through the green fields approaching the woods that surrounded the small pack village area. Jackson chuckled as he agreed reluctantly.\\n\\n“Siblings. What can I say? You’re both headstrong.”\\n\\nScarlett didn’t reply feeling a sense of guilt filling her, she didn’t think of her stepbrother in a brotherly way at all…\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt was later in the evening and after getting her checked by the pack doctor Jackson had bought her home. She had showered, donning a pair of black leggings and a V neck purple tee. The smell of freshly cooked chicken, roasted potatoes, southern fried chicken strips, stuffed peppers, and lasagne wafted into her room. She loved her mother’s cooking. It always felt nice when the weather changed for the worse. It was pouring down outside unlike the clear sky earlier. The joys of British weather she thought morbidly. She did like the rain as long as she was inside but going out in it wasn’t the most enjoyable thing.\\n\\nShe heard the creak of the wooden floorboards outside her room and knew someone was going down the hall, the downside of a traditional style house. It was a large house, the largest in the territory, with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, an office, 2 lounges, game room, a gym room in the basement, kitchen and a dining room. It was a nice old English style brick building with dark-framed windows.\\n\\n“Oi Scar! Come make your mighty presence known at Simba’s coronation!” Indigo shouted. Scarlett closed her eyes and sighed pinching the bridge of her nose.\\n\\n“Shut the hell up Indy!” She snapped back, hating the nicknames her sister had for her.\\n\\n“You know if you got hurt on your face today you would have looked even more like Scar….” Indy’s voice came giggling as she ran off down the hall.\\n\\nScarlett exited her room after donning a pair of black block heels. She didn’t like walking barefoot in the house. Indy simply said it was because she was a midget. Maybe it was true, she felt a little short for werewolf standards…\\n\\nShe walked down the steps, her fingers brushing the dark wooden balcony rail, stopping in her tracks when she saw the front door open. A strong draft of cold air entering the warm house, accompanied by the smell of wet earth and the sweet scent of Fiona Williamson. The girl was stood leaning against the door frame, wearing a white leather skirt, a pale pink peplum blouse and a white leather jacket. Her long tan legs on show, she was a stunning twenty-one-year-old. Scarlett had to admit it with her 5,8 height, long brown waves, and those big hazel eyes...\\n\\nElijah was looking down at her with a smirk on his face, clearly flirting, Scarlett felt a pang of jealousy go through her as she frowned slightly averting her gaze and stalked towards the kitchen.\\n\\n“Oh hey Scarlett.” Fiona said smiling sweetly, stopping Scarlett in her tracks. Elijah turned his gaze falling to her perfect peach, thinking fuck did she have to wear such skimpy clothing… the leggings stuck to her like a second skin shaping her ass so fucking sexily. He was not used to seeing her look this good.\\n\\nScarlett took a deep breath before plastering a smile on her face and turned.\\n\\n“Oh hey Fiona, I didn’t see you there.” She said making Elijah raise an eyebrow.\\n\\n“Really? She’s hard to miss Red… looking this gorgeous anyway…”He added making Fiona blush and pat his chest playfully, Scarlett rolled her eyes.\\n\\n“I know, she really is, but it’s your big fat ass that blocked my entire view.” She retorted making Fiona smile.\\n\\n“This ass is far from fat wouldn’t you agree Fiona?”He said playing with a strand of her long brown hair.\\n\\n“Definitely anything but fat…” She said blushing.\\n\\n“Awe how cute! Well as much as I would love to stay and chat - I really don’t want to discuss Elijah’s ass. Plus I’m really hungry.” Scarlett said crossing her arms, only making Elijah’s eyes fall to her breasts for a split second.\\n\\nFiona laughed “Then I won’t keep you, nice seeing you Scarlett.”\\n\\n“Mm..” Scarlett replied.\\n\\n“Yeah, you should go eat, that ass is definitely not all muscle.” He snickered, making Scarlett turn and glare at him before she stormed off into the kitchen that was glowing welcomingly.\\n\\n“Be nice to her Elijah.” Fiona said in a flirtier tone, “So… I’ll see you tonight?”\\n\\n“Sure… See you tonight, leave your window open.” He whispered into her ear, kissing her jaw before stepping away. Fiona nodded before she walked off swaying her hips on purpose. Elijah glanced at her, thinking she had a fine ass but there was something about Scarlett’s sexy bubble butt that made him hard just thinking about it. He glanced down at the front of his pants, adjusting them, and thinking he really needed to meet Fiona tonight…\\n————————————\\n💋Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here\\nInstall the APP to search for the book title 👉\"Her Forbidden Alpha\" 👈Read more exciting content immediately.', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\n😘 Install APP to read more 👉👉Her Forbidden Alpha\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of read', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 111188005041104', 'page_likes': 43, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '111188005041104', 'ads_count': 28, 'cumulative_ads_count': 120, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:55:45', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:56:00', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:56:25', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\nAll Too Late\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:56:52', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:57:05', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'No Footer', 'footer_action': 'No Action', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 2, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:57:31', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Although she was in a daze, it was undeniable that she still looked sexy.\\n\\nThe sound of running water from the bathroom stopped abruptly, and Samuel Macari came out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around his waist after a while.\\n\\nHe had broad shoulders, a lean body, well-defined abs, and the chiseled features of a male model. No, he looked much better than a male model.\\n\\n“Why are you in a daze?” Samuel\\'s deep and magnetic voice rang out. “Have you thought of what you want?”\\n\\nKathleen regained her senses. She swallowed a lump in her throat as she looked at the man\\'s muscular body.\\n\\n“Is it okay if we don\\'t get a divorce?” Her voice was sweet as usual, and her eyes were filled with a hint of innocence and misery.\\n\\n“Why have you become so ignorant all of a sudden?” Samuel looked at her gently yet coldly at the same time. “Nicolette is back.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s heart sank.\\n\\nOf course, I know that Nicolette is back.\\n\\nNicolette Yoeger was Samuel\\'s childhood sweetheart.\\n\\nUnfortunately, she was not welcomed in the Yoeger family, as she was an illegitimate child.\\n\\nThus, the Macari family did not agree with Samuel marrying her.\\n\\nKathleen, on the other hand, had a clean family background, and she was not the illegitimate child of a rich family.\\n\\nIndeed, her background was very immaculate.\\n\\nHer parents were ordinary doctors, who had unfortunately passed away in an effort to rescue Samuel\\'s grandmother, Diana Lane, from a fire.\\n\\nThe couple had sacrificed themselves in order to save her.\\n\\nTo thank the couple and prevent Samuel from marrying Nicolette, Diana had forced Samuel to marry Kathleen.\\n\\nBack then, Diana had been in poor health, and the doctor had issued several notices of critical illness to Samuel.\\n\\nSamuel did not have any choice but to agree to the arranged marriage.\\n\\nHe had told Kathleen that he would not fall in love with her and that everything was done so that Diana would be at ease.\\n\\nKathleen naturally understood.\\n\\nShe looked very much like a harmless little rabbit. She was gentle and thoughtful and was never a competitive person.\\n\\nThus, he had assured her by saying, “As long as you are still Mrs. Macari, I will not let you suffer. We will get a divorce three years later, and I will compensate you when the time comes.”\\n\\nKathleen looked at him meekly.\\n\\nI married him not because of his money, but because I wanted to fulfill a dream from my youth. And the dream is shattered now. It\\'s time for me to face the reality. I\\'ve been gentle and obedient for three years, but I just couldn\\'t let this man fall in love with me. How pathetic of me!\\n\\n“Sam,” Kathleen called him.\\n\\nShe was the only one who would call him by that name.\\n\\nAnd whenever she called him that on the bed, Samuel could never stop himself from making love to her.\\n\\nShe may look like a small rabbit, but she is a vixen deep down. She is excellent at seducing people.\\n\\nAt the thought that she would probably marry another man after their divorce and of her using that same gentle voice to call another man, he felt a little displeased.\\n\\n“Hmm?”\\n\\nKathleen could see her reflection in his eyes. She mustered her courage and said, “Sam, I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel\\'s face darkened at once. “What did you say?”\\n\\nKathleen trembled involuntarily. She bit her lip and repeated, “I\\'m pregnant.”\\n\\n“Get rid of it,” Samuel said without hesitation.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said get rid of it.” His handsome face was full of hostility. “I\\'m not going to backtrack on my plan to divorce you just because of a baby. Besides, I don\\'t want the baby to become a hindrance between Nicolette and me.”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s face turned pale.\\n\\nIt looks like even a child can\\'t change his decision. How could he tell me to abort the baby? What a cold-blooded man. The baby is his own flesh and blood.\\n\\nKathleen chuckled softly.\\n\\n“Why are you laughing?” Samuel\\'s face clouded over.\\n\\n“I\\'m not pregnant. I lied.” Kathleen had a smile on her face, but her heart was bleeding inside.\\n\\n“You lied?” Samuel was visibly upset.\\n\\n“That\\'s right. If you don\\'t believe me, why don\\'t we go to the hospital for a body checkup?”\\n\\n“Good. I don\\'t want the existence of a potential threat. Abort the baby if you\\'re really pregnant. I\\'ll give you an extra one hundred million so that you can do what\\'s necessary for your health. Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t affect your... second marriage.”\\n\\nSecond marriage?\\n\\nKathleen gave a rueful smile. “I\\'m really not pregnant, so you don\\'t have to give me extra money. If you\\'re worried, we can go to the hospital for a checkup.”\\n\\nSamuel held her chin. “What\\'s your plan after we get a divorce?”\\n\\nKathleen wrapped her arms around his neck. “I wanna join showbiz.”\\n\\nSamuel was stunned.\\n\\nKathleen had graduated from a film academy after taking an acting course.\\n\\nIf not for her marriage to Samuel, she would have won the award for best actress long ago.\\n\\nFor some reason, Samuel did not like the idea of her joining the entertainment industry.\\n\\nHe knew that she was an alluring woman and was afraid that people would have their eyes on her.\\n\\n“Very well. I will add another clause to our divorce agreement. You\\'ll be signed under Starlight Entertainment, and they\\'ll make you famous in five years.”\\n\\nKathleen smiled faintly. “It\\'s fine. I was just saying. How are you going to tell Grandma about us?”\\n\\nSamuel felt the onset of a headache at the mention of Diana.\\n\\nHe knew that Diana would not agree with them getting a divorce.\\n\\nMoreover, Diana did not like Nicolette\\'s identity as an illegitimate child.\\n\\n“You go.” Samuel looked at Kathleen coldly. “She listens to you. I will give you an extra house if it works.”\\n\\nKathleen was at a loss for words, and there was a throbbing pain in her heart.\\n\\nDid he really think that I married him for the money and the house? It doesn\\'t even concern him that he has hurt my feelings.\\n\\n“Fine,” Kathleen agreed. “Sam, make love to me one more time.”\\n\\n“Your wish is my command, you little vixen.” Samuel pulled her out of the blanket and positioned her such that she was sitting on him.\\n\\nTruth be told, he could never have enough of her, for the woman was a delightful treat to him.\\n\\nWhen he realized that he could never taste her again, he acted even harder than before. He wished he could drain her energy.\\n\\nThe night passed by and morning came.\\n\\nKathleen was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing.\\n\\nEven though she was emotionally abused by Samuel, he had pampered her in other aspects.\\n\\nKnowing that she would be grumpy in the morning, he would set his phone on silent or vibrate mode when he arrived home at night.\\n\\nHe was afraid that someone would look for him and wake her up.\\n\\nHowever, unbeknownst to her, he had switched it back off.\\n\\nLifting the phone groggily, she intended to tell him that there was an incoming call for him.\\n\\nBut the moment she saw Nicolette\\'s name on the phone screen, she froze.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the reason for the change. Is he afraid that Nicolette can\\'t find him? What a considerate man!\\n\\nAll of a sudden, Kathleen realized that the past three years had merely been a dream.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it was not without any signs.\\n\\nEven though Samuel did not love her, he had doted on her, for she looked very identical to Nicolette.\\n\\nShe had been Nicolette\\'s replacement for three years.\\n\\nSamuel picked up the call from Nicolette.\\n\\nThere was a gentle look on his face.\\n\\nSamuel was also gentle to her, but that was only because he saw her as another woman.\\n\\nThat was what broke Kathleen\\'s heart the most.\\n\\nNot once had he seen her for who she was.\\n\\nInstead, she was just a replacement.\\n\\nKathleen hated herself for resembling Nicolette so much sometimes.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t even related, but they looked almost identical.\\n\\n“Don\\'t cry. I\\'ll come over right now,” Samuel assured tenderly. Hanging up, he turned to Kathleen and said, “I\\'ll get Tyson to take you to the hospital later.”\\n\\n“You still don\\'t trust me, do you?” Kathleen grumbled in a daze.\\n\\n“Yeah, I don\\'t,” he admitted heartlessly.\\n\\nKathleen pursed her lips, an impenetrable look in her eyes. “Okay.”\\n\\n“Just hurry up and tell Grandma,” Samuel said indifferently.\\n\\n“She hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. Are you sure you want me to tell her now?” Kathleen stared at his cold, handsome face.\\n\\n“Yes. Nicolette can\\'t wait any longer.”\\n\\nNicolette can\\'t wait any longer? Does that mean he doesn\\'t care about Grandma\\'s life and death? I guess true love is enough to make him throw his whole family aside.\\n\\nKathleen knew she had lost, but she had not expected herself to lose so thoroughly.\\n\\n“Fine,” she conceded with a weak nod. “But no matter how much of a rush you\\'re in, you have to give me at least three days.”\\n\\n“Sure. I hope you won\\'t let me down.”\\n\\n“Why would I?” There was a heart-wrenching smile on her face as she said that. “When have I ever let you down, be it in our three years of marriage, or as your wife?”\\n\\nHer words caused Samuel to freeze.\\n\\nIt was the truth.\\n\\nHaving been married to him for three years, she had never disappointed him in any way.\\n\\nShe had done well in every aspect and carried things out flawlessly, especially in bed.\\n\\nKathleen had always given in to him and had tried to satisfy him in every way.\\n\\nThat was the only thing he felt reluctant to give up on.\\n\\n“Good, then.” Samuel turned around and stepped into the walk-in closet to change his clothes.\\n\\nWrapped in the blanket, Kathleen was lost in thought.\\n\\nIs this the end?\\n\\nEven though she was upset, she knew that it wasn\\'t up to her.\\n\\nAfter Samuel left, she got out of bed as well.\\n\\nShe went to wash up, then put on a pretty dress in preparation to go see Diana.\\n\\nHowever, the moment she left, she bumped into Tyson Hackney.\\n\\nKathleen had her arms crossed as she looked at him with displeasure. “What?”\\n\\nTyson was confused.\\n\\nMrs. Macari is certainly an enigma. She acts like a cute, innocent little rabbit in front of Mr. Macari, but in front of me, she\\'s like a hostile version of Hello Kitty.\\n\\n“Mr. Macari wants me to take you for a checkup,” Tyson said.\\n\\n“Hmph!” Kathleen was visibly annoyed. “I can\\'t believe how little trust you have in me.”\\n\\nTyson didn\\'t know how to reply to that.\\n\\n“Take me to Goodwill Hospital,” Kathleen said specifically.\\n\\nIt was the number one private hospital in Jadeborough that was equipped with the best medical equipment and the most qualified doctors in the country.\\n\\nSeeing that there was an unfathomable look in Tyson\\'s eyes, Kathleen asked frostily, “What is it? Too expensive for you?”\\n\\n“N-No.” Tyson didn\\'t know how to explain. “Please get in, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen stepped outside, completely bare-faced, but she still looked stunning.\\n\\nAfter she got in the car, all she did was stare out the window.\\n\\nShe had chosen Goodwill Hospital not because she wanted to act superior, but because her parents had worked there as doctors and she was born there.\\n\\nEveryone working there, from the director to the nurses, all knew who she was.\\n\\nThey all treated her as if she was part of their family.\\n\\nOn top of that, they would undoubtedly agree to help her if she ever asked for it.\\n\\nA long while later, Tyson piped up, “We\\'re here, Mrs. Macari.”\\n\\nKathleen came back to her senses and realized they had arrived at the entrance of the hospital.\\n\\nShe pushed the car door open and stepped out.\\n\\nTyson followed her from behind. He wanted to say something but eventually held his tongue.\\n\\nWhen they got to the entrance of the obstetrics and gynecology department, Kathleen turned around. “Stop right there, Mr. Hackney. Men aren\\'t allowed to go in.”\\n\\nThe moment Tyson saw the sign on the door, a wave of embarrassment washed over him. “Understood.”\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, Mr. Macari should have been the one to come here with her. She\\'s his wife, after all. What\\'s the point of me going with her?\\n\\nKathleen turned and walked in.\\n\\n“Ms. Williams,” she greeted the doctor.\\n\\nQuinn Williams was dumbstruck at the sight of her. “It\\'s you, Kate! I thought it was just someone with the same name as you when I saw the papers earlier.”\\n\\n“Yeah, it\\'s me,” Kathleen uttered while taking a seat.\\n\\n“So you\\'re here to check whether you\\'re pregnant or not?” Quinn asked in surprise.\\n\\nKathleen nodded. “I think I am pregnant, Ms. Williams. Can you help me hide it, though?”\\n\\n“Why?” Quinn looked stunned.\\n\\n“I might be getting a divorce, Ms. Williams. I want to keep the child, but my husband will never allow it. That\\'s why I really hope you can help me out, Ms. Williams,” Kathleen begged.\\n\\n“How could you mess around like that, Kate?” Quinn was both angry and heartbroken. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a single mother?”\\n\\nKathleen hung her head. “I know, Ms. Williams, but I have money. I can still raise this child.”\\n\\n“This has nothing to do with money,” Quinn protested. “Who on earth is your husband? When you told me you were getting married, I kept asking you about it, but you refused to say. Tell me who your husband is right now. Is he treating you like this because your parents aren\\'t around anymore?”\\n\\n“I think it\\'s better if you don\\'t know, Ms. Williams.” It was impossible to decipher any emotion from Kathleen\\'s pale, delicate face. “I knew that all of this would happen when I married him. Now that we\\'re getting a divorce, I have nothing to complain about. That\\'s why I want you to help me out here, Ms. Williams. Once we\\'re divorced, I\\'ll leave this place with the child.”\\n\\nIt\\'s not like I can stay. Samuel will definitely find out.\\n\\nQuinn felt as if her heart was being ripped in half. She\\'s suffering because she\\'s all alone and there\\'s no one to support her.\\n\\n“Kate, if you really don\\'t have any other choice, you should try and plead with Old Mrs. Macari. She sees you as her own granddaughter after all,” Quinn suggested, not knowing what was going on behind the scenes. “Samuel treats you like his own sister, too, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure he\\'ll deal with that husband of yours.”\\n\\nKathleen averted her gaze. “This is the only thing I can\\'t go to the Macari family for, Ms. Williams. Just help me out here, please?”\\n\\n“All right.” Quinn frowned. “Lie down for now and let me have a look.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nAfter the checkup, Quinn pushed her glasses up and stated, “You\\'re already eight weeks in, but it seems that you\\'re a little anemic because of your weak body. You should eat more nutritious food.”\\n\\n“I was a premature baby, so my body\\'s always been a little weak. It\\'s how I\\'ve always been,” Kathleen muttered glumly.\\n\\n“Does your husband not know about this?” Quinn inquired in a serious tone.\\n\\n“He never asked, so I never brought it up,” Kathleen answered in dejection.\\n\\nEven though Samuel had always been generous when it came to providing her with daily necessities, he never had any questions regarding her health. Instead, he would get Maria to take care of it.\\n\\nHis only responsibility was to provide her with money.\\n\\nQuinn let out a sigh, then passed Kathleen a report. “This is what you wanted. I hope you can think things through, Kate.”\\n\\nKathleen stared at the report in front of her. Her lips quirked up. “What I want doesn\\'t matter. When it comes to my marriage, my husband has the final say.”\\n\\nJust as she got up to leave, Quinn called out, “Kate, is your husband—”\\n\\nKathleen turned around with a faint smile. “I don\\'t intend to get you involved, Ms. Williams.”\\n\\nWith that, she proceeded to make her way out.\\n\\nTears began to drip down Quinn\\'s face.\\n\\nKathleen\\'s mother used to be her mentor, yet there was nothing she could do to help Kathleen.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know how she was going to face her own mentor.\\n\\nWhen Kathleen came out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, she showed Tyson the report in her hands. “Take a good look. I\\'m not pregnant, so you can go now.”\\n\\nWhat she said made Tyson feel awkward.\\n\\n“Where are you heading, Mrs. Macari? I\\'ll send you there.” Here, he paused and added in a softer voice, “Mr. Macari told me to.”\\n\\n“I don\\'t like being followed around. You can tell Samuel that I will look for Grandma, but I have something else to do right now,” Kathleen declared.\\n\\n“Understood.” Tyson nodded.\\n\\nKathleen turned and left.\\n\\nAfter taking two steps, she realized that she had forgotten to take her phone, so she went back to get it.\\n\\nWhen she came out again, someone stopped her by calling her name.\\n\\n“Kathleen.” Nicolette\\'s voice traveled into her ears.\\n\\nKathleen froze. How did I end up bumping into her?\\n\\nShe turned around quietly and looked at Nicolette, who was dressed in a hospital gown and looked a little pale.\\n\\nEven so, she still looked gorgeous.\\n\\nDespite the physical resemblance between them, their temperaments were completely different.\\n\\nKathleen was alluring, but there was something innocent about her.\\n\\nNicolette, on the other hand, was purely priggish.\\n\\nThe two of them were worlds apart.\\n\\nKathleen furrowed her brows and asked, “Why are you here?”\\n\\nNicolette stared back at her icily. A glint of envy flashed in her gaze. “I\\'ve been admitted to the hospital for leukemia.”\\n\\n“Leukemia?”\\n\\n“Samuel was the one who arranged for me to get admitted here.” Nicolette smirked. “Oh, right, I heard that the treatment for leukemia in this hospital was perfected by your parents.”\\n\\nHer words disgusted Kathleen. She didn\\'t like the idea of Nicolette receiving the treatment that her parents had perfected.\\n\\n“Good luck with your treatment, then,” Kathleen said emotionlessly.\\n\\nShe wanted to leave, but Nicolette stopped her again. “Give Samuel back to me, Kathleen.”\\n\\nKathleen paused.\\n\\n“If it isn\\'t because you snatched him away, I would have been the one who married Samuel three years ago. Because of you, we were separated for so many years, and now, this is the state that my body\\'s in. Do you still intend to have him all to yourself? He doesn\\'t even love you!” Nicolette continued.\\n\\nKathleen remained expressionless. “What a joke. If he wants to get a divorce, then he should be the one talking to me about it. Why are you the one saying it? Is he that much of a coward?”\\n\\nThe truth was, she knew that Nicolette had only said that on purpose to provoke her and let her know just how much Samuel cared about Nicolette.\\n\\nEven though Kathleen was aware of it, that didn\\'t change the fact that it hurt.\\n\\nShe had loved him for so many years, after all.\\n\\n“Samuel just feels bad,” Nicolette muttered through gritted teeth. “You think it\\'s natural for you to be with Samuel because you lost your parents and Old Mrs. Macari likes you. But you seem to have forgotten that he doesn\\'t love you. Not even a tiny bit!”\\n\\n“How can you be so sure?” Kathleen challenged.\\n\\nNicolette was dazed upon hearing that.\\n\\n“Why would he touch me if he didn\\'t love me?” Kathleen continued taunting.\\n\\nNicolette trembled slightly. Right then, she looked behind Kathleen. “Samuel?”\\n\\nKathleen froze for a second and smiled calmly. I guess I fell for it in the end.\\n\\nShe turned around and was greeted by the sight of a cold, striking man.\\n\\n“I came here to get a checkup. I\\'ll be on my way now,” Kathleen said.\\n\\n“And what were the results?” Samuel questioned in a frigid voice.\\n\\nKathleen pulled out the lab report and stuffed it into his suit pocket. With a grin on her face, she answered, “Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not pregnant.”\\n\\nSamuel took the report with a slight discomfort in his heart.\\n\\nTruthfully speaking, he had had his hopes up.\\n\\nHowever, the feeling soon dissipated.\\n\\n“Well, since you\\'re not pregnant, let\\'s discuss the future,” he suggested in an unconcerned manner.\\n\\n“Are you sure you want to talk about that here?” Kathleen looked aggrieved. “I haven\\'t even eaten yet just so I could get a checkup.”\\n\\n“Go eat, then,” Samuel responded impassively.\\n\\n“Take me there.” Kathleen smiled. “We can talk while we eat.”\\n\\nSamuel stared at her without any warmth in his eyes. “Don\\'t try anything funny.”\\n\\nKathleen giggled, which was music to one\\'s ears. “If I had tried anything funny, you would have been kneeling in front of Grandma at this moment. All I\\'m asking is that you join me for a meal.”\\n\\nSamuel furrowed his brows.\\n\\n“You can go with her, Samuel. I\\'ll wait for you in the hospital,” Nicolette piped up, pretending to be understanding.\\n\\nKathleen beamed and grabbed Samuel\\'s arm. “If you say so, Ms. Yoeger. Let\\'s go, then. There\\'s a place nearby that I\\'ve been wanting to try for a while.”\\n\\nNicolette watched as they linked arms with venom in her eyes.\\n\\nSamuel glanced at her and said, “Go back to the ward and get some rest. I\\'ll be back soon.”\\n\\n“Okay.” Nicolette bit her lip. “Hurry back. Let\\'s eat lunch together.”\\n\\n“Sure.” Samuel nodded.\\n\\nKathleen dragged him outside, and they went to the nearby restaurant that she had mentioned.\\n\\nShe took one menu, looking relaxed. “What are you getting, Sam?”\\n\\n“I\\'m not eating.”\\n\\n“You\\'re trying to save some room in your stomach to have lunch with Nicolette later, right? I get it.” Kathleen gestured for the waiter. “Can I get one quinoa salad? Also, I want a plate of chicken drumsticks. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Sure.” The waiter nodded, then walked away.\\n\\nSamuel knitted his eyebrows. “Why are you eating so much?”\\n\\nHe knew that Kathleen typically had a small appetite. She would be full after just a few bites.\\n\\n“Really, Sam? I only ordered a bowl of quinoa salad and some chicken drumsticks, and you think I\\'m eating too much? Has your company gone bankrupt or something? Are you poor now?”\\n\\n“Just eat.”\\n\\nSometimes, her cheekiness was adorable. Other times, however, it was plain infuriating.\\n\\nEven so, Samuel had to admit that it hadn\\'t been too bad waiting for Nicolette to come back for the past three years with Kathleen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the food was served, Kathleen began to dig in.\\n\\nShe was practically starving at that point, and so was the baby she was carrying.\\n\\nAs she chewed her salad, her cheeks puffed up. That action of hers was incredibly cute, and she looked just like a squirrel.\\n\\n“What did you want to say to me?” Kathleen asked softly.\\n\\n“What did Nicolette tell you just now?”\\n\\nKathleen frowned. Is he trying to settle the score?\\n\\n“She told me that she had leukemia.”\\n\\n“That\\'s true. I went to check for a bone marrow match for her. Surprisingly enough, there\\'s a donor in this hospital whose blood type is a perfect match for her. Can you guess who it is?”\\n\\nKathleen\\'s eyelid twitched. “You mean... me?”\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nDue to the word limit, it can only be updated here!\\nInstall the APP to search for the title \"All Too Late\" Enjoy Romance Now ;)', 'footer_text': 'PLAY.GOOGLE.COM\\nAll Too Late\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'The world of reader', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 101082842736363', 'page_likes': 118, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '101082842736363', 'ads_count': 44, 'cumulative_ads_count': 170, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 21:57:56', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

Your sister has had a rough time out there for more than 20 years, and here you are planning to snatch the man from her. How could you?!”\\n\\nCatherine looked at her mother incredulously. “Mom, Ethan is my boyfriend. How can you guys be so unreasonable?”\\n\\nCatherine had just come home after a business trip, only to see her long-lost elder sister, Rebecca Jones, sitting with her boyfriend, Ethan Lowe, on the couch. Her sister, who returned not long ago, was holding Ethan’s arm and seemed intimate with him.\\n\\nSeated on the other side of the couch were both Rebecca and Ethan’s parents who were having a pleasant chat with each other.\\n\\nIn fact, Ethan was Catherine’s childhood sweetheart!\\n\\nShe could not help but come up to Rebecca to question her. However, she ended up being slapped by her mother in the face right there and then!\\n\\n“Mom, please stop hitting Cathy.” With an anxious look, Rebecca said, “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back…”\\n\\nEthan quickly held her shoulders. “No, Rebecca. It’s my fault. I’ve always treated Catherine as my sister, which is probably why she misunderstood my feelings for her.”\\n\\nSomething seemed to have exploded in Catherine’s head. The pain was so terrible that she could barely breathe.\\n\\nSister?\\n\\n“Stop!” She found those words unbearable.\\n\\n“You’re the one who should shut your mouth. Is this how you’re supposed to speak to your sister?” Mrs. Jones told her off sulkily. “Can’t you just be tolerant of Rebecca, considering that she has gone through 20 years of hardships?”\\n\\nShocked, Catherine was slightly slack-jawed.\\n\\nThere had to be some limit on tolerance anyway. Why should she give up? She was not a saint either.\\n\\nAt that point, Mr. Jones stood up and told her off glumly as well. “Are you done? Ethan isn’t into you either. We still need to discuss Rebecca’s engagement party now. Get lost. You’re such an eyesore here.”\\n\\nCatherine trembled and glanced at Ethan who was indifferent toward her. She then glanced at Rebecca who was clinging to him.\\n\\nAll of a sudden, she felt like a joke.\\n\\nThese people were the ones she cared most about, yet every one of them was taking Rebecca’s side at that moment.\\n\\nTears were seen streaming down her face.\\n\\nAfter wiping away the tears, Catherine turned around and left with her suitcase without looking back.\\n\\nShe sped through the journey once she got into the Maserati.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go, she stopped and called her best friend, Freya Lynch.\\n\\n“Come and have a drink.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nBy the time Freya rushed over to S1897 pub, Catherine had already finished one whole bottle of drink by herself.\\n\\n“You came at the right time. Let’s have a drink together. I’ve ordered a lot.”\\n\\n“What’s wrong?” It was very rare for Freya to find Catherina behaving in such a manner. She sympathized deeply with Catherine. “Where’s Ethan? Is he ignoring you?”\\n\\nAt the mention of Ethan’s name, Catherine felt as if a knife was scraping her heart.\\n\\n“He’s ditched me, and he’s going to get engaged to Rebecca.”\\n\\nFreya gaped. “What kind of a campy plot is this?”\\n\\nCatherine briefly told her what happened that evening.\\n\\nFreya felt a sense of incredulity. Ethan and Catherine were childhood sweethearts who had established a romantic relationship since high school.\\n\\nThroughout these years, however, Catherine studied abroad while Ethan was busy with work. It explained why they had yet to get engaged.\\n\\nBoth their parents were under no illusions about it. They also gave their blessings to the couple.\\n\\nEveryone in the entertainment industry knew that the couple would get married sooner or later.\\n\\nNow, it turned out that Ethan had gotten together with Rebecca, which would then make Catherine a laughing stock.\\n\\n“This is absurd. You and Rebecca should be equally important to your parents. Are your dad and mom out of their minds?”\\n\\nCatherine clutched the bottle. “They probably feel that Rebecca has suffered too much out there. Now that she’s back, they just want to give her the best.”\\n\\nFreya was in a state of disbelief. “But you’re their daughter too!”\\n\\nCatherine forced out a smile.\\n\\n“Hah. Now that Rebecca has returned, all they care about is Rebecca.\\n\\nHolding the bottle, Catherine started feeling a little dizzy.\\n\\n“Don’t drink too much. You have a poor stomach. You’ll feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.”\\n\\nFreya grabbed Catherine’s bottle to divert her attention from it. After that, she glanced around the pub.\\n\\nNever did she expect to see a familiar figure.\\n\\n“Hey, look there!”\\n\\nFreya gave Catherine a push and pointed to the man who was sitting at a corner.\\n\\nDespite the dim glow at that corner, the man was faintly visible. He wore a suit which was inappropriate for the occasion.\\n\\nThe man had his eyes closed and was leaning against the couch, giving off an aura of brilliance. When the rotating spotlight shone on him from time to time, he looked so attractive that his face was just like the perfect side profile one often saw in comic books.\\n\\nAfter a glimpse, Catherine averted her eyes from him. “No matter how attractive he is, I’m in no mood to enjoy anything that’s pleasant to the eye right now.”\\n\\n“I’m trying to tell you that the man is Ethan’s uncle.”\\n\\nCatherine was momentarily stunned. “Are you sure?”\\n\\nEthan previously mentioned that he had a mysterious uncle. However, his uncle managed a company in a foreign country, so she had never seen him.\\n\\nA few days ago, she heard that his uncle had returned.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’m very sure. My brother told me when we attended a party the other day. I heard he’s clever with tricks. Even Zachary is at his mercy.”\\n\\nZachary Lowe was Ethan’s father.\\n\\nCatherine’s eyes glowed. She had an idea crossing her mind at that instant.\\n\\n“Well… What do you think will happen if I marry his uncle?”\\n\\n“Pff…” Shocked, Freya spat out the wine from her mouth. “Say that again.”\\n\\nCatherine gazed intently at the tall, handsome figure. “Since I can’t become the Lowe family’s daughter-in-law, I shall be Ethan’s aunt to fill the couple with uncomfortable!”\\n\\nChapter 2##\\nFreya was momentarily dumbfounded. She then showed Catherine a thumbs up right away.\\n\\n“I’m on your side! His uncle’s appearance is perfect. Even Ethan isn’t as good-looking as his uncle. His uncle’s wealth and power are also comparable to that of the Lowe family.”\\n\\n“I need to remind you that you have to find an excellent match or your position in Jones Corporation will be inferior to Rebecca’s. So I think his uncle is suitable for you!”\\n\\nCatherine was dazed for a second. Freya might be straightforward, but what she said was true.\\n\\nIf Rebecca had the Lowe family backing her, Catherine’s position in Jones Corporation would be at stake.\\n\\n“Okay, I’m going to capture his heart right now!”\\n\\nCatherine snatched Freya’s purse on impulse to search for lipstick and foundation.\\n\\nHer pure face soon looked radiant.\\n\\nFreya blinked. “Uh, are you sure you can deal with him?”\\n\\n“He’s just a man, isn’t he? Hah!”\\n\\nCatherine swept her hair over one shoulder, then held a half-full glass of drink. With a tipsy and pretty look, she walked toward the man proudly.\\n\\nThe closer she got to the man, the clearer his exquisitely handsome face became. His clean, somber eyebrows and exquisite nose bridge were nothing short of attractive.\\n\\n“Hi. Sorry to bother you, but could you tell me the time now?”\\n\\nCatherine tapped her finger on his shoulder twice.\\n\\nWhen the man opened his eyes under the dim light, the word ‘devil’ flashed through Catherine’s mind.\\n\\nHer brain shorted out for a few seconds. After regaining her senses, she wore a pretty smile and said, “I think our first encounter here is the start of our happiness.”\\n\\nWith furrowed brows, Shaun Hill coldly said, “I’m not a doctor. I don’t provide treatment.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re crazy, aren’t you?” The man’s lips moved slightly. Nevertheless, the words that came out of his mouth were extremely mean.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAt that moment, Catherine felt like getting a mirror to take a hard look at herself.\\n\\nWas she not pretty? Really?\\n\\nAnyway, it was impossible to grasp men’s thoughts. Otherwise, Ethan would not have betrayed her.\\n\\n“I’m actually crazy, crazy for you.”\\n\\nCatherine swiftly calmed down and gave an embarrassed smile. “I started getting crazy when I met you for the first time.”\\n\\nWhen Shaun raised his eyebrows a little, Catherine immediately seized the opportunity to say, “They say one can’t help feeling happy when they meet the love of their life, and this is exactly how I’m feeling at the moment.”\\n\\n“Alright, I got it. You may leave now.”\\n\\nThe man averted his eyes away from her in a careless manner. From his expression, it seemed that he was unbothered by her.\\n\\nCatherine was deeply hurt. She was a great beauty and the pride of Sydney. At this moment, she had the urge to turn away. The moment she pictured herself becoming Ethan’s aunt, however, she summoned up the courage to talk to him again.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could I add your contact to my WhatsApp?”\\n\\nLying on the couch lazily with his eyes closed, Shaun looked delicately elegant.\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you give me your number?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, could you tell me your name?\\n\\n“Pretty boy, you look so charming with your eyes closed that women just find it irresistible.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nAnnoyed by the owner of the voice, Shaun opened his eyes and asked in annoyance, “What on earth do you want?”\\n\\n“I want to marry you,” Catherine blurted out.\\n\\nThe corners of Shaun’s mouth twitched.\\n\\nWhile smiling, Catherine added, “Actually, I’m quite a catch. I’m 22 this year, and I graduated from the University of New South Wales. I’m a competent woman who does well both at home and in public. Moreover, I’ll pamper my husband. I’m capable of earning money too. I’m healthy and don’t have any bad habits. Above all, I’m not a fickle lover.”\\n\\nShaun was speechless.\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, then gazed at her strangely.\\n\\nCatherine raised her hand. “I can swear that from now on, I’ll only treat you well and promise you everything I’ve said…”\\n\\n“Stop.”\\n\\nShaun was so fed up with her that he stood up.\\n\\nOnly when Catherine looked up did she realize that he was really tall. He was close to six feet and two inches, and furthermore, he had such a wonderful figure.\\n\\n“If you want to marry me, bring your birth certificate and meet me at the registry office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.”\\n\\nThe man stared down at her with one hand in his pocket.\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. She then stammered, “Are you lying to me?”\\n\\n“You can give it a go.” Upon looking away, Shaun turned around and swaggered to leave.\\n\\nChapter 3##\\nThe plot twist happened so quickly that Catherine suspected she had drunk too much.\\n\\nSuch a thought remained until Freya came to tap her on the shoulder. She said sympathetically, “Don’t get too upset. It’s not easy to capture the heart of a wealthy and handsome man. Keep it up—”\\n\\n“No. He told me to meet him at the entrance of the registry office tomorrow at 10 a.m.,” Catherine replied with a dazed look.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nFreya remained uncannily quiet for a moment before she burst out laughing. “Congratulations on becoming Ethan’s aunt!”\\n\\nCatherine asked, “You believe him?”\\n\\nFreya forcefully pinched Catherine’s soft face.\\n\\n“Why not? Please. With your naturally pure look, you can easily beat those young ladies in the entertainment industry. Let’s go and have a drink to celebrate your marriage.”\\n\\nCatherine seriously wondered how much Freya had drunk while she was away.\\n\\nHowever, Catherine began to have a hangover after drinking just now. She felt her head becoming heavy.\\n\\nA Bentley Mulsanne slowly moved toward the pub entrance.\\n\\nThe valet opened the car door, and Shaun subsequently went to the backseat.\\n\\nShaun frowned a little. “Who else knows that I’m in Melbourne?”\\n\\n“No one except Senior Madam.”\\n\\nShaun’s brows relaxed. By the look of things, the woman’s appearance just now was sheer coincidence. “Find out who this person is. I want to know her information before dawn.”\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe morning sun shone through the curtains.\\n\\nCatherine, who was deep asleep, was woken by the noise outside.\\n\\nJust as she opened her eyes, she saw Ethan opening the door and striding into her room.\\n\\nFreya, who followed him into the room, roared. “This is my house! You’re basically invading my home!”\\n\\n“Sure enough, you’re here.” Ethan stared keenly at Catherine who had bloodshot eyes and slightly messy hair.\\n\\nCatherine became wide awake at that moment, her eyes expressing dejection.\\n\\n“The two of you should have a good chat. It hasn’t been easy being together for so many years.” After some thought, Freya turned around and left, closing the door behind her.\\n\\nThe room was silent. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Ethan stretched out his hand to touch her hair.\\n\\nWith a scornful look, Catherine dodged away from his hand. “Does Rebecca know that you’re here?”\\n\\nEthan’s handsome face froze, then he clenched his fist. “Cathy, you’re probably unaware that the Jones family has decided to give Rebecca 80 percent of the company’s shares.”\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that her lips turned pale. “This is impossible.”\\n\\n“It’s true. Your dad said it himself.”\\n\\nCatherine seemed to have grasped everything within minutes.\\n\\nTears began to gush from her eyes. “So that’s why you abandoned me and chose Rebecca, right?”\\n\\nEthan gripped her hands. “This is just temporary. I’ve just gotten engaged to Rebecca, but I’ll leave our wedding on the back-burner. As you know, my dad has an illegitimate son. If I don’t do this, I wouldn’t even be able to compete. Cathy, I just want to provide you with a good life.”\\n\\n“Liar.”\\n\\nCatherine snatched her hand out of his grasp and threw insults at him. “You’re only 25. Even if you don’t get any inheritance from your family, can’t you just start your own business?”\\n\\n“You’re too naive.”\\n\\nEthan stood up slowly, hiding the emotions in his eyes. He said helplessly, “It’s not in our power to choose certain things due to our background.”\\n\\nCatherine looked cold without uttering a word as she found it unreasonable.\\n\\nAmid the silence, Ethan sighed softly. “Give me three years, Cathy. You’re still young. You can afford to wait.”\\n\\nCatherine nearly went mad.\\n\\nHow dare he say such things in a self-righteous manner when he only wanted to make her keep her youth for him?\\n\\n“Please get out of my face. I don’t want to see you anymore!”\\n\\n“Time will show my love for you.”\\n\\nSince Catherine was not going along with what he said, he decided to turn around and left.\\n\\nUpon hearing the door shut, Catherine flung a pillow to the wall with reddened eyes and spent a few seconds sitting still. After that, she frantically put on her shirt and dashed out.\\n\\n“He’s left. What’s the point of going after him?” Freya quickly stopped her.\\n\\nCatherine took a deep breath, then gnashed her teeth. “I agreed to meet him at 10 a.m. to get married.”\\n\\nFreya said, “You actually believe him?”\\n\\n“Didn’t you say you believed him last night?”\\n\\nFreya embarrassedly replied, “That’s because I drank too much.”\\n\\n“What if he’s serious about it?” Catherine pushed her away and ran out.\\n\\nChapter 4##\\nCatherine took a taxi directly to the Jones family’s house. At that time, Mr. Jones had already gone to work.\\n\\nShe rushed upstairs to take her birth certificate. Just as she walked to the living room, she saw Rebecca coming out of the study with a large pile of documents.\\n\\nRebecca looked pure with a bob and a pristine face.\\n\\n“You’re finally back, Sis. I was still worried about what happened yesterday.” A guilty look spread across Rebecca’s face. “It’s just that Ethan is really not into you. You can’t force someone to love you.”\\n\\nCatherine shot her a cold gaze. “Enough is enough. You can stop acting since there’s no one else here. I underestimated you before this.”\\n\\n“Don’t treat me this way.” Rebecca bit her lip, her tears streaming down her face. “I’ll just yield to your demands in the future, okay? I won’t get involved in matters related to the company. I’ll pass you these documents.”\\n\\nAs she was speaking, she shoved the documents into Catherine’s hands.\\n\\nCatherine found it strange and subconsciously extended her hands to push the documents away. As a result, all the documents dropped to the floor.\\n\\n“What are you guys doing?”\\n\\nSuddenly, Sally Lennon walked down the stairs and caught sight of Rebecca’s teary face as well as the scattered documents.\\n\\n“Aren’t these the company’s documents that your dad asked you to go through?”\\n\\n“Don’t be mad at her, Mom. It’s my fault.” With a pale face, Rebecca hurriedly explained, “Cathy asked me to stop getting involved in the company’s matters and hand these documents to her. I was planning on giving her the documents, but she’s probably unhappy about the issue with Ethan, so—”\\n\\n“You’re lying—”\\n\\n“Stop!” Sally glared at Catherine. “Who gave you the right to have a hand in the company’s matters? It’s your dad and me who asked Rebecca to go through the documents. Rebecca will officially become the manager of the company next week. You’d better behave yourself.”\\n\\nCatherine was dumbfounded. “Speaking of education and experience, I’m more qualified than her. Despite joining the company one year earlier than her, I’m not even a manager yet. What gives her the right to jump to a managerial position just like that?”\\n\\n“Mom, I’d better not become a manager. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Cathy,” Rebecca immediately said while sobbing.\\n\\nSally’s heart ached very badly. “Look how much Rebecca cares about your sisterhood. What about you? You’re narrow-minded and calculating. You’re not even qualified to be a manager. No wonder Ethan would choose Rebecca instead.”\\n\\nHer mother’s cruel words felt as if she was getting hit by a cane.\\n\\nAs anger rushed through her body in a way that had never happened before, Catherine took two steps backward. “Fine. Since I’m so terrible, I’ll leave, okay?”\\n\\nShe went to her room right after she finished speaking. She got a suitcase and subsequently stuffed her clothes into it.\\n\\nRebecca’s voice came from the door. “Mom, Cathy’s mad. We should talk her out of leaving.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother with her. That’s just how she behaves. She has been pampered too much. She’ll come back two days later. Let’s go and buy you some clothes since you’re going to get engaged soon.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nSoon, the voices became faint.\\n\\nWith large teardrops falling on the back of her hand, Catherine carried her suitcase down the stairs. After that, she drove her car and left.\\n\\nAfter 40 minutes, Catherine saw a man’s figure at the entrance of the registry office. The man looked smart dressed in a perfectly ironed white T-shirt. He was tall and sturdy, giving off an aura of brilliance.\\n\\nShe rushed toward him after parking her car. “You actually came.”\\n\\nThe woman’s voice was filled with surprise and joy.\\n\\nWhen Shaun turned around, he smelled the flavor that lingered on her body from the night before. “Didn’t you take a bath?”\\n\\nCatherine felt embarrassed right away. “I drank too much last night, so I was already unconscious when I arrived home. I was in a hurry this morning, so…”\\n\\nWhen she realized the man’s increasingly disdainful gaze on her, she quickly swore, “Today was just an exception. I usually take a bath every day and I love to keep myself clean.”\\n\\nShe observed his features as she spoke.\\n\\nIt was normal to find a man more attractive under the dim lighting of a pub. Nevertheless, one would notice that he was not that good-looking during the day.\\n\\nHaving said that, this man was an exception.\\n\\nNot only was he not any less attractive, but he looked even more stunning with his elegant and cool features. He had a handsome face, and what was more, there were not any pores visible on his skin.\\n\\nCatherine was aware that a few young women who were going into the registry office to get married were casting glances at him.\\n\\n“What a handsome man.”\\n\\nThe man beside the woman said, “The girl looks pretty too.”\\n\\n“That’s true. They match each other well. Their future children will probably be good-looking, unlike ours. How worrying…”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nWhen the discussion reached Shaun’s ears, he said straight away, “We won’t have children.”\\n\\nCatherine was at a loss for words.\\n\\nShaun said, “We’ll divorce three years later. I’ll give you a sum of money which will be enough for you to live the rest of your life. Also, I won’t meet your family. Think about it carefully. If you can’t go along with this deal, you can leave.”\\n\\nCatherine felt like something was stuck in her heart.\\n\\nShe was under the impression that he liked her at first sight last night.\\n\\nShe did not mind him not loving her at first sight, though.\\n\\nWith her charisma, she believed that she could win the man’s heart in three years’ time.\\n\\nShe had to consolidate her identity as Ethan’s aunt.\\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\nOnce the two of them entered the registry office, they first went to take pictures together.\\n\\nThe cameraman, who had spent a long time taking pictures of them, was not satisfied with the outcome. “Can’t you guys get close to each other and look sweet? Also, sir, please smile.”\\n\\nAn impatient look crossed Shaun’s face. Catherine immediately hooked her arm around his, then said with a smile, “His facial nerves have been damaged, so don’t force him anymore. Just let him be.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nDeeply insulted, Shaun shot an icy glare at the woman who was wearing a cheery smile.\\n\\n“You’d better stop talking if you want to stop taking pictures,” Catherine whispered in his ear boldly while standing on tiptoes. Her scent lingered on his ear, tickling him.\\n\\nChapter 5##\\nShaun froze and remained silent.\\n\\nAfter Shaun and Catherine were done taking pictures, they headed to the first floor to register their marriage.\\n\\nIt was only when Shaun took out his citizenship certificate that Catherine finally learned his real name—Shaun Hill.\\n\\nHowever, Ethan’s mother’s surname was Lyons. In that case, his uncle’s surname was supposed to be Lyons as well.\\n\\nIn a daze, Catherine asked, “Why is your surname Hill?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh.”\\n\\nAs Shaun was lowering his head to sign the documents, he did not bother to know what she meant. He casually answered, “I adopted my mom’s surname.”\\n\\n“Oh.” Catherine finally understood. She had been filled with fear earlier, thinking that it was a case of mistaken identity.\\n\\nShe approached him for the very reason that he was Ethan’s uncle.\\n\\nHowever, she felt that something was somehow not right.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the marriage certificates were issued.\\n\\nCatherine felt a twinge of sadness but found this to be incredible at the same time.\\n\\nSince young, she had always assumed she would marry Ethan. Against her expectations, she married a man whom she had only met once.\\n\\n“Here’s my contact number. I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.” Shaun jotted his number on a piece of blank paper for her before he left.\\n\\n“Wait a minute…” Catherine stopped him the moment she came back to her senses. “Now that we’re a married couple, we should live together.”\\n\\nWith a dull expression, he replied, “I don’t enjoy living with someone else.”\\n\\n“I’m your legal wife, not someone else. Even if we’re going to divorce three years later, we should still live together.”\\n\\nShaking the marriage certificate in her hand, Catherine pouted in an attempt to gain his sympathy. “I’m really miserable. Ever since my long-lost sister returned, my parents have been treating me with contempt. Now that I’ve been kicked out of the house, I don’t have a place to stay.”\\n\\n“You can go and rent a place.”\\n\\nShaun walked away with indifference.\\n\\n“Don’t abandon me, hubby!” Catherine suddenly let out a howl, hooking her arm around his. “I’m left with nothing but you right now.”\\n\\nHer increasingly loud voice had attracted a lot of sidelong glances in the registry office.\\n\\nPulling a long face, Shaun regretted getting married to her at random.\\n\\n“Fine. I live in Jadeite Bay. Go there on your own.”\\n\\nShaun could not help but stomp out of the registry office. He then warned her softly, “You’ll sleep in the guest room. You’re not allowed to step into my room.”\\n\\nSecretly elated, Catherine believed that he would be the one begging her to enter his room in the future.\\n\\n“By the way, don’t disturb Fudge.”\\n\\n“Fudge?” Catherine gasped. “You already have a son?”\\n\\nShaun raised his eyebrows. “Take good care of him.”\\n\\nOnce he finished his sentence, he left straight away.\\n\\nCatherine was so shocked that he forgot to go after Shaun. Although she had braced herself to marry someone she did not love, she was not at all ready to be someone’s stepmother.\\n\\nShe stood at the roadside for half an hour, picturing her conflicting future identities—namely as a stepmother and aunt.\\n\\nAt last, she dashed into the mall to buy children’s toys after glancing at Ethan’s photo.\\n\\nA person named Fudge had to be a boy. After selecting several types of toy cars and Lego sets, she drove to Jadeite Bay.\\n\\nCarrying a variety of things, she took a deep breath in front of the door. She punched in the password and the door was opened.\\n\\nA friendly smile spread across her face. “Hi, Fudge—”\\n\\n“Meow!”\\n\\nA cat with a white body and light yellow ears was seen lying on the couch lazily. It produced a cute sound in the quiet living room.\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine blinked. “Fudge?”\\n\\n“Meowww!”\\n\\nAfter the cat stretched its body, it jumped down the couch and walked toward her legs to smell the toys that she was carrying. Uninterested, the cat returned to the couch and lay on it in an arrogant manner.\\n\\nChapter 6##\\nCatherine was speechless.\\n\\nShaun should have explained this earlier.\\n\\nShe had spent the past few hours worrying about being a stepmother!\\n\\nA feeling of helplessness washed over her.\\n\\nCatherine let out a sigh. Then, she scanned around the house that had three bedrooms and two living areas.\\n\\nThere was a master bedroom, a guest room, and a study.\\n\\nThe interior of the house was decorated in a minimalist. It was pleasant to the eyes but gave out a cold and cheerless vibe at the same time.\\n\\nWas this really the residence of Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nThe man was supposed to be a successful entrepreneur. It was one thing if he chose not to live in a grand villa, but there was no sign of luxury in this place at all.\\n\\nNot to mention the shelves in the study room were filled with books like The Science of Law, The Law Society Gazette, and Are We Slaves to Our Genes?\\n\\nSomething did not feel right. Could it be possible that this man was not Ethan’s uncle?\\n\\nNo, that would be impossible!\\n\\nFreya could be quite careless at times, but for something as serious as this…\\n\\nShe could not possibly have made a mistake, right?\\n\\nThe overthinking was killing Catherine. She retrieved her phone to ring her friend. “Are you sure that he’s Ethan’s uncle?”\\n\\n“Of course, I heard it from my brother. He even had a meal with that man before.”\\n\\n“I was afraid that I married the wrong man.”\\n\\n“Oh my God, did you actually marry him?” A shriek of surprise sounded over the phone. “He really showed up?”\\n\\n“Uh-huh,” she replied. On the other side of the phone, Freya’s eyes were welled up with tears. “We promised to be each other’s angels. How could you abandon me in the blink of an eye?”\\n\\nThe words were stuck in Catherine’s throat.\\n\\nAfter the phone call ended, Catherine dropped by the nearby supermarket. The new house was too cold and empty to be called a home. It definitely needed a new makeover.\\n\\n...\\n\\n4:00 p.m. at Jennings Solicitors.\\n\\nShaun had just flipped open the document file when Chase Harrison stepped foot in his office.\\n\\n“Congratulations! Should we have dinner with your new wife tonight?”\\n\\n“It’s not like you don’t know the real reason why I got married,” Shaun replied coolly without lifting his head, his eyes glued to the words on the documents.\\n\\n“You truly are inconstant in love. I heard that Catherine Jones is quite a beauty. Aren’t you at least a little bit interested?”\\n\\nChase was filled with excitement. He lowered himself on the swivel office chair as he studied his friend’s expression with curious eyes.\\n\\nShaun paused what he was doing for a split second. He recalled the woman’s smooth, milky skin and her face that was as beautiful as a blooming flower. However, her behavior...\\n\\nHe replied several seconds later, “I’ve seen countless attractive women.”\\n\\n“Fair point. An insignificant young lady from Melbourne wouldn’t stand a chance to be your wife if you weren’t trying to avoid an arranged marriage set up by the elders of your family. Indeed, she’s not a good match for your grand status.”\\n\\nChase let out a meaningful sigh. “So, the famous undefeatable legend has returned. How are you adapting to working in a small place like Melbourne?”\\n\\n“It’s certainly an experience to live like a common person.”\\n\\n“Tsk.” Chase hissed. “The world is so unfair. We graduated at the same time but you’ve already climbed to the top of the ladder.”\\n\\n“It all comes down to the structure of our brains,” Shaun replied, lifting his indifferent gaze.\\n\\nChase gritted his teeth at the humiliation. “Forget it, I’ll leave this as is. Do me a favor, let’s have dinner with several other solicitors of the company tonight.”\\n\\n“Hmm,” Shaun replied. His phone then beeped with a notification sound.\\n\\nHe picked up his phone to see an incoming text from someone named ‘Shaunerine’.\\n\\n[Hubby, this is Cathy.]\\n\\nChapter 7##\\nShaun did not know what to reply. He massaged the space between his eyebrows and accepted the message request.\\n\\n[Hubby, will you be home for dinner?] Catherine sent another text within seconds.\\n\\nShaun: [No. Don’t call me that.]\\n\\nShaunerine: [Fine then, I’ll call you Shaunny. It’s a cute name.]\\n\\nHe did not know what else to say.\\n\\nWas it too late to back out of the marriage arrangement?\\n\\nLater that night.\\n\\nThe group of people was enjoying dinner in the interestingly designed courtyard-style restaurant.\\n\\nThe bunch of lawyers exchanged their opinions on the new cases recently taken in by the law firm.\\n\\nShaun listened absent-mindedly when he heard a notification alert on his phone again.\\n\\nCatherine sent him a picture. Under the illumination of the soft yellow lights, the chubby cat was indulging itself in a small treat of dried fish.\\n\\nShaunerine: [Shaunny, don’t worry about us. I’m taking such good care of little Fudge.]\\n\\nShaun sighed grudgingly. The greedy cat had been bribed effortlessly.\\n\\nThe time was 9.30 p.m.\\n\\nThe passcode entered unlocked the door. Shaun was evidently stunned the second he set foot into the house.\\n\\nIt appeared that his house had undergone a complete makeover. The couch was decorated with peacock blue cushions. The white dining table was covered in a green table cloth with a wave pattern. A glass vase filled with pink hydrangeas sat quietly above it.\\n\\nThe entire house was decorated with green plants and fresh flowers. There were also several hanging baskets out on the balcony.\\n\\nWas this still his house?\\n\\nDid he enter the right place?\\n\\n“Shaunny, you’re home.”\\n\\nCatherine walked out of the guestroom wearing a long sleeve silk sleeping gown. Several white bunnies were printed on the red material of the gown.\\n\\nHer thick and long brunette hair that was the color of milk tea was draped over her shoulders. Beneath the hem of her gown were her fair legs.\\n\\nShe looked like an elf.\\n\\nShaun’s eyes darkened. “Who allowed you to dress like that around here?” The brows on his forehead twitched into a frown as he said sternly.\\n\\n“Like what?” The woman swirled innocently. “All the young girls go out in the streets dressed like this. What’s wrong about it?”\\n\\nHe did not know where to look. Indeed, she was not wearing revealing clothes, but she was also not wearing anything underneath.\\n\\nThe man averted his gaze. “I agreed to let you move in, but I didn’t give you permission to do this to my house.”\\n\\n“Isn’t this better? It was too empty before that it didn’t even feel cozy like a home should.” Catherine showed him her palm. “Look, I even have a few cuts on my palm from moving the plants around.”\\n\\nHe lowered his gaze to have a look. Indeed, there were a few tiny cuts on the tender skin of her delicate palm.\\n\\n“You deserve it.”\\n\\nHe uttered softly before retreating to his room.\\n\\nAnnoyed, she pulled a face at his departing silhouette.\\n\\nThis man did not show any care for women at all. She would not be trying so hard to please the cold man if not for the plan to become her ex’s aunt.\\n\\n7:00 a.m. the following day.\\n\\nShaun’s biological clock woke him up early every morning at the same time. He bumped into the woman who was brushing her teeth in the bathroom.\\n\\n“Good morning, Shaunny. Are you going for a morning run?” Catherine’s eyes landed on his sportswear. The basic outfit felt like a classic style on the man as if he was the spokesperson for the brand.\\n\\nThe man had a bad temper, but his impeccable appearance was undeniable.\\n\\nBesides, the habit of going out for morning runs showed that he was a man of discipline.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nShaun was a little surprised.\\n\\nYoung women her age were not normally early risers.\\n\\n“Well, don’t get breakfast before you come home. I’ll prepare something for you,” she spoke like a proper housewife, “It’s more hygienic than store-bought food.”\\n\\nHe frowned. “No need for that. When are you planning to move?”\\n\\nHer pretty face froze for a split second. “Although we’re married, I don’t want to get too involved with you. Don’t waste your time on me because I’m not interested in you at all,” he replied.\\n\\nThen, he left the house.\\n\\nCatherine pulled at her hair slightly as tears immediately welled up in her eyes.\\n\\nShe stood there motionless in the living room for a brief moment. Quickly, she collected herself and started making breakfast.\\n\\nThe man returned after jogging around the park. A delicious smell came from the kitchen, making him hungry in an instant.\\n\\n“I made breakfast. There are churros and cinnamon rolls...”\\n\\nShe poked her head out from behind the kitchen door while wearing a light green apron that was dotted with little daisies.\\n\\n“I don’t like sweet things for breakfast.”\\n\\nHe refused coldly. The straightforward remark he made earlier this morning was meant to drive her out of the house. Unexpectedly, she stayed behind and even made him breakfast.\\n\\nWould the food she made be edible?\\n\\nAt first glance, she looked like a pretty spoiled young lady who had never done a single chore in her life.\\n\\nHe was accustomed to seeing women like her.\\n\\nShaun retrieved a carton of fresh milk from the fridge.\\n\\nCatherine pouted.\\n\\nIt appeared he was determined not to try the food she made.\\n\\nWhat a pretentious man.\\n\\nRegardless, she had no problem enjoying the food herself.\\n\\nShe returned to the kitchen to continue making churros.\\n\\nHe appeared a few seconds later to warm up the milk. From the corners of his eyes, he noticed the woman shaping the dough into several long sticks in a practiced manner before placing them into the hot oil. Within seconds, golden logs floated to the top of the oil. They released a delicious smell that attacked his nostrils.\\n\\nA hint of light flashed across his eyes.\\n\\nThis skill must have been acquired from years of practice.\\n\\nHe shifted his gaze downward. Beautiful cinnamon rolls with chocolate swirls were baking in the hot oven.\\n\\nHer cheeks were tinted with a rosy pink because of the heat in the kitchen. Her skin was unquestionably beautiful. She did not have the defined sharp jawline that was favored by most social media influencers nowadays. Her slightly chubby cheeks made her appear youthful and adorable.\\n\\nCatherine noticed him staring and playfully picked up a churro, waving it in front of his eyes. “Shaunny, are you sure you don’t want a taste of this?”\\n\\n“Not interested.”\\n\\nHe averted his gaze and placed the milk inside the microwave. Then, as if out of habit, he placed a piece of bacon between two slices of toast and shoved in a handful of lettuce. He started munching on the sandwich by the dining table.\\n\\nThe sandwich in his mouth suddenly tasted bland when he thought of the golden brown churros.\\n\\nFrustrated, he covered one side of the toast with a thick layer of fruit jam.\\n\\nRight then, the woman reappeared from the kitchen and placed a whole feast in front of his eyes. Churros, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, a cup of hot chocolate…\\n\\nShaun twitched his brows into a deep frown as she blinked innocently. “Shaunny, you don’t mind me eating here, do you?”\\n\\nHe watched on silently as she began the show.\\n\\nHer performance was better than he expected. “Please forgive me for having a sweet tooth. I really can’t endure having to start the day with a bowl of boring cereal or a plain sandwich. It would be a huge disappointment for my tastebuds.”\\n\\nThen, she took a massive bite of the churros. She closed her eyes as a look of satisfaction washed over her face.\\n\\n“The flavor just bursts in your mouth. Mhmm, it’s so delicious.”\\n\\nHe remained silent.\\n\\nWhat a waste of talent that this woman did not pursue an acting career. How could he still eat his plain sandwich now?\\n\\nChapter 8##\\n“It’s a must to enjoy warm pancakes with high-quality butter. Then, a sip of hot chocolate to go down with it.”\\n\\nCatherine continued on with the eating show.\\n\\nShe was savoring every bite of food in earnest. Taking her pretty face into account as well, her performance was way more entertaining and convincing than the other eating broadcast shows available.\\n\\nShaun could not take any more of this.\\n\\n“Meow.” At the same time, Fudge leaped onto the dining table while wagging its tail.\\n\\nThinking the cat must be hungry, he walked over to the cupboard. He returned with a plate of cat food and placed it before Fudge.\\n\\nFudge sniffed it for a few seconds before turning its head away. It looked at Catherine with greedy eyes.\\n\\nAn awkward expression flashed across the man’s face.\\n\\nShe suppressed the desire to laugh before feeding the cat a small piece of the cinnamon roll. The little cat devoured it within seconds.\\n\\n“Good kitty.”\\n\\nShe patted the cat on the head lovingly. ‘You have much better taste than your owner,’ she thought to herself.\\n\\nShaun felt embarrassed. After the cat ate two more bites of the cinnamon roll, it went on to enjoy the churros. This put a frown on the man’s forehead.\\n\\n“You…”\\n\\nCatherine seized the opportunity and shoved a piece of churros into his mouth.\\n\\nA hint of anger flashed across his eyes. Just when he was about to spit it out, the crispy outside of the churros that were coated with cinnamon sugar melted on his tongue.\\n\\nInstinctively, he began chewing on the dense dough. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was delicious.\\n\\nSurely, he had had churros before. The cooks from Hill household could make numerous kinds of food, but nothing tasted as good as this.\\n\\nFor some reason, the churros that she made brought out the creamy flavor of the milk without making it sickly.\\n\\n“Is it nice?” Catherine asked, cupping her chin with both hands. She was confident in her cooking.\\n\\nThe light went out of his eyes when he noticed the smug smile on her face.\\n\\n“It’s just alright.”\\n\\nThen, he picked up another piece of churros and continued eating. The small bite from earlier was not enough for him to taste its full flavor properly.\\n\\nShe winked playfully. “Didn't you say it’s just alright?”\\n\\n“Surely you can’t finish all these. I don’t like wasting food,” the man replied calmly.\\n\\nShe parted her lips to retaliate, but he interrupted with a frown, “Keep quiet during meal times.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine gasped in astonishment as she had never seen anyone like him.\\n\\nHe had said coolly that he did not like having sweet foods for breakfast, but he was now devouring the churros, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls—the hot chocolate too.\\n\\nHe sure had the cheek!\\n\\nInitially, Shaun only wanted to have a little taste of the food, but everything that she made was exceptionally delicious. They were even better than the ones he tried in restaurants.\\n\\nIt was definitely out of his expectation that this woman could make such a scrumptious breakfast.\\n\\nHis impression of her changed a little. Coincidentally, she turned her face toward him and their eyes met. “Shaunny, what do you want to eat for dinner? I’ll make it for you,” she said gently.\\n\\n“I have a dinner appointment tonight.”\\n\\nThen, he left to get changed in the bedroom without another word.\\n\\nThis did not annoy her. It was not unusual for the boss of a multinational business to be occupied with work.\\n\\nHowever, it was still important to maintain a good relationship between them.\\n\\nShe cleaned up the table immediately and hurried off to get changed into work clothes too.\\n\\nWhen Shaun was about to leave the house, she quickly reappeared from her room with her purse.\\n\\n“Shaunny, can you give me a lift? I’m heading off to work as well. If it’s too much trouble, you can just drop me off at the subway station. Please.”\\n\\nHe pursed his lips while thinking of refusing. However, he eventually nodded upon considering that he had enjoyed the breakfast she made today a lot.\\n\\nThe two of them took the elevator to the parking lot.\\n\\nCatherine thought she would be getting into a Bentley or a Maybach, but when the man stopped by the side of a white Lexus…\\n\\n“Um… Is this your car?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\nHe opened the door and sat down in the driver’s seat.\\n\\nConfused, she followed suit and entered the car. “Shaunny, why did you choose this car?”\\n\\nThis man was supposed to be the heir of a multinational business, yet he was driving a car that was worth only a little over 300,000 dollars?\\n\\n“It’s cheap and fuel-efficient,” he simply replied while igniting the car.\\n\\n“You do know the best way to live, my exceptional husband.”\\n\\nShe turned her head aside to find a packet of cheap tissue on the dashboard. Its packaging read ‘### Gas Station—cheapest and easiest.’\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nCatherine was confused.\\n\\nDid all successful bosses nowadays live frugally like this?\\n\\nCould it be possible that she was not treated well by the Jones because she had been spending lavishly instead of saving up like other successful bosses?\\n\\nShe fell into deep thought as she pondered over this.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the car came to a halt by the subway station. He turned to face her. “Off you go.”\\n\\n“...”\\n\\nShe was speechless.\\n\\nShe only said that out of politeness but he really did as told.\\n\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nWhile suppressing the anger rising inside her, she forced a shy smile on her face. “Thanks, Shaunny.”\\n\\nThe second she stepped out of the vehicle, the car sped away before she could say something else.\\n\\nWhat an annoying and cruel man!\\n\\n…\\n\\nShe only arrived at the company around 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nSince returning from her studies abroad, she had been working at Summit Building Design Group. It was the Jones family’s biggest corporation.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as she stepped foot into the building, the project manager, James Lennon, said to her in a strange voice, “You don’t have to show up starting from today. This project doesn’t belong to you anymore.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nJames’ eyes sparkled when he spotted someone behind her. “Rebecca, here you are.”\\n\\nCatherine snapped her head around and saw Rebecca approaching their direction wearing a low-cut knitted white top. On her right was Ethan who was wearing a shirt of the same color. Their arms were linked together.\\n\\nThe sunlight that streamed into the room through the window enveloped the two of them. They looked like a blissful couple in their matching outfits.\", 'footer_text': 'ITUNES.APPLE.COM\\n“Boss, the traitors are all killed. But they have a daughter.

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:03:06', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:03:22', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

She left even before her case was tried .\"\\n\"I know Katerina, she must have left for a reason, Ryegrass .\"\\n\"Who I\\'m I to inject my opinion? She is your mate and the bond between the both of you was very strong .\"\\nWoods moved away from Ryegrass a bit. He wasn\\'t feeling comfortable around him and couldn\\'t figure out why .\\nHis late father had once told him, \"anytime you feel uncomfortable around a werewolf, be very careful .\"\\nHis father may be dead but he connects to him one way or the other through a mind link .\\n\"Go on with your haunting Ryegrass I shall see you tomorrow .\"\\nHis words were final. Ryegrass left immediately transforming and running into the forest .\\n\"He seems harmless, father .\"\\n\"I told you not to trust anyone, I told you .\"\\nThe voice of his father echoed to him through a mind link .\\nHe transformed back into a werewolf and ran into the thickness of the forest .\\n***********************\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\" the head witch laughed out boastfully .\\n\"I shall take my revenge. Yes, I shall take my revenge on all of them until they\\'re wiped out completely .\"\\n\"But why take revenge on the innocent?\" Aquila asked. She sounded pitiful .\\n\"Be quiet for you know nothing .\" The head witch retorted .\\n\"I know the story. Their forest fathers are the ones guilty .\"\\n\"Oh, my dear Aquila, you are just like your mother naive and stupid .\"\\n\"Do not insult my mother .\"\\n\"How dare you talk back at me?\" The head witch asked her, pointing at her .\"\\n\"For this,\" she continued, \"I shall cast a spell upon you .\"\\nShe moved close to Aquila and touched her with her wand .\\nAquila lost the ability to communicate using the mind link instantly .\\n\"Why did you do that?\" one of the other witches asked .\\n\"I don\\'t trust her, she might expose us .\"\\n\"Is this war really necessary? It\\'s been over decades since the incident happened. The present settlers are only living on instructions passed by their fathers, who also obeyed their fathers .\"\\n\"You lost your mother to them have you forgotten? My mother too and even Aquila\\'s mother. Isn\\'t that enough reason for her not to be nice to these creatures called werewolves?\"\\nShe paused as though she remembered something she had forgotten to say .\\n\"These creatures do not like us, they call us evil. Any attempt to play near their territory will get you killed. Only a few have survived it in the past .\"\\n\"Show her mercy. Undo the spell .\" Another witch suggested .\\n\"Not yet, let her remain that way for a day or two. She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 90, 'cumulative_ads_count': 90, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:03:39', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 937, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:03:55', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

I opened it and saw him looking at the two laptops on the table that was on the side. The laptop was wired to the CCTVs .\\n\"You\\'re calling me?\" why am I stuttering? He took a deep breath and stared at me. He looked at the tray I was carrying. I cleared my throat and approached his desk and landed in the vacant space there .\\nI couldn\\'t look at him so I looked around his room .\\nSofa set in front of flatscreen tv. There is a table here with a swivel chair. A king-size bed covered by a black cushion. also, black colored carpet lying on the floor. In one word. ‘Manly’ is really his room .\\nI was just standing there by his side. He leaned back in his swivel chair and he applied his back to its backrest. He looked tired but so handsome. I mean, no words can explain his appearance. There is nothing wrong with our race .\\n\"Why you are late? I cook your favorite .” He asked that I was simply tired of looking. I want to be embarrassed .\\n\"We have a practice for the prom ..\" I explained. Maybe papa will keep an eye on me. He nodded and played a game of his hand lip. I looked at his lips for a moment and immediately avoided...He smirked and licked his lips ... am I obvious?\\nHe stood up so I looked up because of his stature. He took a step towards me .\\n\"Four more nights you were late coming home .\" every step he takes forward he is my back. Gosh..what is he doing?\\nI blinked as I couldn\\'t look at him directly. Then three more thrusts..he was my back. I immediately felt the cold wall. Dead end .\\n\"Who drives you here?\" he asked seriously but I don\\'t think I heard. The noise of my heart rate overcame me more. I was just stunned when he bowed slightly so we could line up. He put his both hands on either side of my head...\\nI cursed a million in my mind. I am nervous. The speed of my heartbeat. I took a deep breath. I forgot our distance just a few feet away. The heat of her body seemed to attract me.\\n\"Distance, please! I can\\'t breathe,” I said coldly to him and pushed him slightly but he was harder he didn\\'t move .\\n\"Shall I repeat my question Roxette?\" I could hear the anger in his voice there .\\nI gritted my teeth with so much emotion. \"Why? Why are you asking? Because dad asked you? me that you should watch? Your sweet uncle then. \"\\nHis jaw clenched. The vein came out of his arm because his fist was already clenched on my side. I was nervous because of that .\\nHe leaned closer. His nose was so close to mine. Just a little movement will apply to our lips. Does he know what he is doing?\\n\"I\\'m watching you the way I want. I don\\'t need anyone else\\'s notice. Now, answer me. Who is that? Boyfriend?\"\\nI stared at him. \"he\\'s Simon. A friend, not a boyfriend. \"I focused my gaze on his lips. It was nice to pull the nape and kiss him. oh! It\\'s justice to me! Why is this handsome creature, my uncle? He suddenly bit his lips so I turned around and looked into his eyes .\\nHis hand touches my lips ..\"Who\\'s your first kiss?\" He asked huskily in a cold voice .\\nI swallowed and shook. \"Nothing yet ..\"\\nBut I remember the one on the veranda. His lips slightly touched my lips then. But just a little! I don\\'t know if it was the first kiss?\\nHe nodded briefly. \"What if ....\" he tucked some strand of my hair in my ear .\\n\"I kiss you right now? What will you do?\" He whispered that only the two of us could hear .\\nI was shocked as if my whole being shaken at what he said. What! I bit my trembling lips and looked at his lips again. hmm..inviting .. what does it taste like? So soft?\\nHis kiss on my cheek made me close and he slowly moved his lips closer to mine. My leg shook as his lips lightly touched mine. He pressed my waist. But my lips were not completely covered when there was a knock on the door .\\nI took a deep breath and pushed him. He seemed to have poured cold water on my body. Oh my god ...\\nI covered my lips as he looked up and covered his forehead as if angry .\\n\"Who\\'s that ?!\" he shouted .\\n\"Ah, Sir! ! Here\\'s what you\\'re asking for from the boutique ...\" said the maid outside the door .\\nSav walked there while I was looking for a captain because I thought I would collapse. I raised my hand on the table and rewind in my mind what happened. I heard the door close so I looked up. He has two boxes that are large and one that is small .\\nhe handed it to me. \"For you...\"\\nI blinked and took it. \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"Open it ..\"! his husky voice .. insane voice... He\\'s really my ideal man. I laid it on the table and took off the ribbon that was rolled up in the big box .\\nI gasped in surprise. It\\'s a cocktail dress!\\n\"Oh my god..it\\'s beautiful!\" I gasped in awe. How did he know that the cocktail dress was the motif at our prom? Gosh .\\nHe nodded. It was gray with glitters. That tube type but no cleavage. It\\'s just straight, not V neck. Seems like I don’t want to show my chest? It\\'s really super nice. It fits me even if I just look. I also took off the roll of a box and found those silver stilettos! nice!\\nI smiled and looked at him. \"Thank you, really!\" He bit his lip as he looked at me. A hint of amusement plastered on his face .\\n\"All for you..baby ..\"\\nChapter 6\\nIt was a big mistake. The attraction I feel for Sav. Many handsome flirts with me, but why with my uncle? What kind of heart do I have? Tsk. I buried it all in oblivion, I also don\\'t know why he moves the same way towards me? He even asked me what if he will be my first kiss?\\nWhen that incident ended two days ago. Everything became normal. Sometimes we share breakfast. He was just cold. He always has a cellphone call that he calls babe. He also comes home at night once, he is drunk. That hurts my heart, I think my heart is abnormal .\\nOf course, it\\'s wrong to like him, my uncle. That was the most painful part of me. just really unfair. But, I will try my best. So, hard to keep this feeling. I know I can find a man for me too, but I\\'m not ready yet, fling will do .\\nWe are in the MOA now. I went with my driver because I don\\'t know how to drive yet and because it\\'s still forbidden for someone like me who is seventeen years old. I really don\\'t want to go with the driver once in a while because Jezel went to see us a lot .\\nWe came from practicing folk dance at school and we went straight here because we have something to buy for tomorrow. It\\'s the last day of our practice today and our prom is coming...\\n\"Did you tell Gerald that his necktie should be gray?\" Jezel asked me. Gerald was my partner at the prom. He’s a nerd. I prefer him to the others who are too smooth. Gerald isn\\'t ugly, he\\'s really just a need to look at because of his big glasses. Gray and black is the motif of our prom. So my cocktail gown is gray so Gerald and I should have a suit .\\n\"Yep!\" I answer and look at the VS perfumes lined up. One of the perfumes in my collection. I took the night\\'s seduction and smelled it. The scent was really nice!\\n\"Will you be picked up?\"\\nI shook. \"Uncle Savier will drive me .\" note the sarcasm in uncle\\'s word. He said he would take me. He was also invited because he is one of the sponsors of St. Dominic.\\n\"Wow. The sweet one .\"\\nI stared at him. \"Shut up .\" I also choose dark red lipsticks. because my other lipstick is pink, so it\\'s different. Jezel is just next to me and asking .\\n\"Maybe they\\'re Miss Ocampo?\" I stopped at his question. Yeah, those past days. He always goes to school and picks up Miss Ocampo. Our New English school teacher. she\\'s pretty, matured, and an ideal girl. That’s why I spend time practicing to avoid being non -judgmental .\\nI have no right to get mad. Whoever he wants, I can do nothing but support him. That\\'s my role being his niece .\\n\"Who cares? They\\'re something .\" I said bitterly and took the purchases and went straight to the counter while Jez was just tailing .\\n\"E \\'why do you seem sad? Tss! I told you Rox, move on. That feeling will kill you!\" She whispered to me as I paid. After being paid I walked out. I did not answer Jez. My chest tightens. That\\'s why I\\'m avoiding it .\\n\"Rox! Sorry! Are you mad?\" Jez chased me .\\nI smiled bitterly as we exited. \"I\\'m trying Jez. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let my uncle hurt me .\" She took a deep breath and put her arm around me.\\n“Just. I’m only here when you\\'re sad. Hmm? \"\\nI rolled my eyes. \"You\\'re a drama!\"\\n\"Chee, I don\\'t know about you .\" We laughed as we got into the car. I just finished dinner and entered the room. Since I was excited about the prom I prepared everything I would need. the cocktail gown I hung on the hanger and placed in the closet. The stilleto. The makeup is all set. The earring, bracelet, and contact lens, etc. I was stunned to hear Sav’s car just arrived. It\\'s nine o\\'clock and he\\'ll just arrive?\\nI took a deep breath and thought he might not have eaten yet. So I went down because I knew the two helpers were asleep. Going down the stairs, the door suddenly opened and Sav entered, apparently drunk but still smiling. My attention was divided when I saw a woman leading him. or I must say, It’s miss Ocampo .\\nIt turned white dress with flowers. The body is curved and high heels are still on .\\n\"Where\\'s your room babe?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Where\\'s your room2x?”Tsk. Sav\\'s smile on Miss Ocampo\\'s body was so close that it gave my heart pain. Before they could go up. I sneezed .\\nThey both stopped and I saw Sav look at me seriously. no more naughtiness. Well... I\\'m just assuming too much. Why would the uncle be sweet to his niece? And when else was it legal for the uncle to kiss his niece? It\\'s a sin!\\n\"Why are you here Miss Ocampo?\" I asked formally .\\nShe suddenly formalized. \"Hmm...Sav was drunk so I supported him .\" I nodded so that Sav could almost fall asleep on her shoulder .\\n\"Any help? Because he\\'s heavy .\" She added. I had no choice but to help them. Why is he so drunk?\\n\"-Why is he drunk miss?\" I asked as Sav landed on the bed. He groaned as his back pressed against the bed. He’s just wearing a gray T-shirt and pants .\\nMiss Ocampo shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. He drank l the spirits would be like water. Hmm..by the way, does he live here?\" She asked .\\nI nodded. \"I\\'ll just get some lukewarm water .\"\\nI quickly went to the kitchen and got lukewarm water and filled it with liquor. I also took a wipe. I was annoyed because another woman entered his room. stop it Rox. He\\'s your uncle! He already has a girlfriend!\\nMy chest tightened as I went back upstairs to his bedroom. I opened the door and shuddered at where I stood. My innocent eyes! Miss Ocampo is already on Sav\\'s lap. We\\'re kissing torridly. Miss Ocampo\\'s tube dress had fallen off and Sav was already taking off his t-shirt. He held Miss Ocampo\\'s waist and caressed her butt! They were groaning and moaning...\\nI was cold and shivering as the bowl of lukewarm water I was holding collapsed. They immediately separated and stopped. Miss Ocampo immediately left Sav’s lap .\\nI didn\\'t look at them and just bowed. \"I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t know I\\'m sorry!\" I close my eyes and immediately turn around before they can see my tears. I immediately ran to my room and locked it. I ran to sit on the floor on the side of the bed and leaned back on the bed .\\nI was caught in my chest tightening and I could barely breathe. My sobs echoed in the four corners of my room. I wiped away my tears .\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be hurt!\" I built a cup on my chest. “I hate this F-feeling ! I hate my h-heart! \"\\nI was stopped by a knock on the door from outside. \"Rox! Open the door!\" Sav\\'s hoarse cry. Only in its voice will you know that it has been drunk .\\nI remained silent and sobbed. I was speechless. I\\'ve seen him bring a woman here a few times but it hurts more to see what they\\'re doing .\\nI stopped and was even more nervous when the door suddenly opened. What? I locked it! Sav came in, still topless and holding a key. That\\'s why. I averted my eyes when I saw his anticipating look. His eyes were bulging and he was obviously drunk. I can’t look at his handsome body and has eight abs. Darn. He took a deep breath and I could see his footsteps approaching .\\nI closed my eyes firmly with my heart pounding. the crash that I only feel when he\\'s there. His effect on my heart was really strange. This is so bad. He bowed in front of me. One knee was kneeling on the floor and the other was raised and placed his arm there .\\n\"Let\\'s talk,\" he said hoarsely. I immediately inhaled the smell of his breath mixed with mint and liquor. I opened my eyes and my tears flowed. His palm rose and wiped away my tears which I immediately avoided .\\n\"Don\\'t touch me. Just talk .\" I said coldly .\\nHe heaved and sighed. \"Okay ..\" he raised his hand to my side. I hugged my knee .\\n\"Why did you follow? What about your girlfriend?\" I asked. It was hoarse from crying and trembling .\\n\"Who won\\'t follow if you\\'re crying?\" He insisted. His jaw clamped dangerously. He seemed to have lost his drunkenness .\\n“You care ?!” I Spat. \"Don\\'t pretend, please. I\\'m fine. Go away .\" New tears flowed. I bit my trembling lips .\\n\"Why are you crying?\" Instead, he asked. Why? Should I tell the truth? It was as if I had just put myself in harm\\'s way .\\n\"Go aways! you dirty man! Go away! \"I shouted and slapped him on the face and chest. I didn\\'t care if his handsome face got hurt. He didn\\'t stop me, he just let me go. Until I got tired of the beating. His face was red. and I did not even bear my blow to him. He\\'s massive and strong. So maybe that\\'s just not in him .\\n\"You\\'re done?\" He parted the strand of hair on my face. I shunned .\\n\"I hate you!\"\\nHe nodded .\\n\"Why are you crying? May I know why?\" He asked softly .\\n\"Because I hate you,\" I answered immediately. He grabbed my chin and faced him. His dark and expressive eyes were really beautiful. The thick eyebrows and sharp nose. His naturally red lips. He\\'s perfect .\\n\"Hating your uncle is normal. Do you know what\\'s wrong? the wrong is if you love more than a normal love. Not as an uncle, but as a man. ” I stiffened in my seat .\\nThose past years there was no such partnership with us. He always makes business trips abroad. And busy at work. I bit my lip and bowed. My chest is pounding. What does he mean? Am I too obvious?\\n“Did you know I’m ready to fight the whole world for someone? Do you know I’m just waiting for the chance to let her know how I feel? I will fight for us. Even if this family breaks up. \" He said seriously. He looked straight into my eyes .\\n\"W-What are you saying?\" I whispered .\\nHe leaned closer and kissed my forehead and my nose ... then he stops. \"If I will ask you, to run away with me... Would you?\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79577\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:04:11', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

Their forest fathers are the ones guilty .\"\\n\"Oh, my dear Aquila, you are just like your mother naive and stupid .\"\\n\"Do not insult my mother .\"\\n\"How dare you talk back at me?\" The head witch asked her, pointing at her .\"\\n\"For this,\" she continued, \"I shall cast a spell upon you .\"\\nShe moved close to Aquila and touched her with her wand .\\nAquila lost the ability to communicate using the mind link instantly .\\n\"Why did you do that?\" one of the other witches asked .\\n\"I don\\'t trust her, she might expose us .\"\\n\"Is this war really necessary? It\\'s been over decades since the incident happened. The present settlers are only living on instructions passed by their fathers, who also obeyed their fathers .\"\\n\"You lost your mother to them have you forgotten? My mother too and even Aquila\\'s mother. Isn\\'t that enough reason for her not to be nice to these creatures called werewolves?\"\\nShe paused as though she remembered something she had forgotten to say .\\n\"These creatures do not like us, they call us evil. Any attempt to play near their territory will get you killed. Only a few have survived it in the past .\"\\n\"Show her mercy. Undo the spell .\" Another witch suggested .\\n\"Not yet, let her remain that way for a day or two. She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 90, 'cumulative_ads_count': 90, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:04:27', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

You should listen to what i have for you before jumping into conclusion\" The man said calmly .\\n\"I don\\'t want anything from you, i know you paid me more than you\\'re supposed to but i...\" Disha was saying but stopped when she heard the man\\'s next word .\\n\"I need a nanny for my daughter and i want you to apply for it\" He said leaving her in three seconds shock .\\nA nanny?\\nFor his daughter?\\nHe has a child already?\\nWow!\\nWho would want a worker as a nanny for his daughter?\\nThis sounds crazy!\\n\"I..i why do you want me as your daughter\\'s nanny?\" Disha asked not sure of the shock she\\'s recovering from .\\nIs it the shock that he already has a child or the shock of him wanting a worker as his daughter\\'s nanny .\\n\"I just want you as my daughter\\'s nanny\" He shrugged like it\\'s nothing but she know deeply that there\\'s something behind it .\\nWhat if he wants to harm her .\\n\"I\\'m not interested!\" She said sternly before walking into the bathroom .\\nDisha walked out of the bathroom fully dressed and was not surprised when she found the creepy man gone .\\nHe must have figured out that she know of his plan .\\n\"What if i had fell for it\" She said shuddering at the thought..\\nWell..Madam Pinky would not give her to a dangerous man .\\nShe picked her bag and hurried out of the room without looking back .\\nShe got downstairs where the bar was situated and sighted Madam Pinky from afar .\\nShe walked towards the pretty woman who was in her early fifties, her short curly hair was dyed gold and her face was all made up,her lips shone with the red lip gloss she applied .\\nHer tight gown was made of leather which has tiny sparkle all over it,her shoes blinked also .\\nShe dresses that way every single day and if you don\\'t know her well enough, you\\'ll never know she\\'s a fifty plus woman .\\nShe looks far younger than her age .\\nWith her appearance,one will think she\\'s a stern woman but she\\'s so nice and down to earth .\\nShe treats her customers right which always make her bar full to the brim .\\n\"Disha\" She smiled widely as she saw Disha approaching her .\\nAmong her workers, she has a special liking for disha she knows Disha doesn\\'t like the job but she needs all the financial help she can get and that\\'s why she only calls for Disha when there are influential people around .\\n\"Madam Pinky\" Disha called .\\n\"Do you need a drink?\" Madam Pinky asked .\\n\"No\"\\n\" So..how was it?\" She asked with a little smile, knowing the lady is always unhappy after the job .\\nIf only she has the degree to get a more decent job .\\n\"He gave me much more than my pay\" Disha said .\\n\"I knew it! Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:04:43', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 937, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:04:59', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:05:14', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report .\\nA couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my shaft stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my release, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing release-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my shaft. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my shaft, begging me to fill her. Was her hip still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn\\'t long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind\\'s focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn\\'t even have her phone number .\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn\\'t have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn\\'t out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she\\'d reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted .\\nHer proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat\\'s drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself.\\nThe wait for Kat\\'s message wasn\\'t long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here .\\n\"John -- I can\\'t believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me .\\n\"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don\\'t need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love risk. Feeling your release inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I\\'ve had in years. You can\\'t imagine how excited I was, having your release in my panties. My private part was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven\\'t indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the bimboty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges .\\n\"This won\\'t all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You\\'d be surprised at all the things we\\'ll be able to do. Did you know I wear a hip plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn\\'t have them until now. And now I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to stop .\\n\"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I\\'ve always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat\"\\nTo me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn\\'t come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat\\'s apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely undressed. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her private part and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled .\\n\"You taste so sweet,\" I said .\\nShe smiled and said, \"I get so wet thinking about your shaft. I need it in me .\" She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking private part on irresistible display. \"Don\\'t be gentle,\" she said. \"And I haven\\'t done my hair yet .\"\\nI simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of hip cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, \"Harder .\" I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a chest and tweaking her papilla firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her cherry briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my shaft never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her private part. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone .\\n\"Yes! yes!\" she moaned .\\nI released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute doll. Her magic private part never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my shaft .\\n\"I own you,\" I growled. \"This is my cherry, you bimbo .\"\\n\"Yes! Yes, sir!\" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her climax building. I moved her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her private part spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her private part, flowing down my shaft and her thighs .\\nIt was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. \"Jesus, Kat, you\\'re going to make me release,\" I shouted .\\n\" that\\'s so hot,\" she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. \"Just fill me .\"\\nI closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. \"Oh, god, here it comes,\" I said. It was as if I couldn\\'t control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, \"Yes, baby!\" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my shaft in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix .\\nWe were panting. I grabbed a handful of hip again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me .\\n\"I\\'m on fire,\" she said. \"You really do own me .\"\\nI kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her private part. \"Squeeze it out,\" I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine .\"\\n\"You\\'re like a Kitty Kat when you\\'re being a bimbo like this,\" I said. \"The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night .\"\\nShe gave a soft moan and showed me the release before she swallowed. \"I like that,\" she said and paused. \"You have no idea how bad I\\'ve needed this .\" She moved to kiss me, then pulled back .\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy people I am .\"\\nWe embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too .\\n\"That was so hot,\" Kat said .\\n\"I like to be in control,\" I told her .\\n\"I need to be controlled,\" she said. \"Within reason .\"\\nI laughed and changed the subject. \"I have no idea how you\\'re going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap .\"\\nShe smiled her TV smile and said, \"Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think .\"\\nI raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at .\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bedroom. \"I\\'ll let you in on a really big secret,\" she said. \"No judgment, okay?\"\\nI nodded. \"I\\'m not in a position to judge .\"\\nShe directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above undressed heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, \"Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away .\" My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual .\\nKat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, \"It\\'s all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?\"\\nI smiled, broadly and genuinely. \"I have always loved a party girl,\" I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss .\\nI sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of release out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a pro .\\nI replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. it was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat\\'s habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke bimbo had a gravitational pull .\\nWhile Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. \"Is this the day of the week that you have your hip plug in? Or were two loads of release enough?\" I said .\\nI finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. \"There is never enough release,\" Kat replied .\\n\"That didn\\'t answer my question,\" I responded .\\n\"No,\" she answered immediately, \"it\\'s not plug day .\"\\n\"Prove it,\" I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled .\\nIt was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop .\\nAs I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again .\\n\"Satisfied?\" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her hip, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot .\\n\"Good girl,\" I wrote back. \"But not satisfied .\"\\nI silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.\\nKat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, \"But not satisfied .\" It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:\\n\"Daddy, please, I need it .\" It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her hip cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess hip plug snugly in her hip .\\nAfter that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Undressed greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent . Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn\\'t become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside .\\nTo be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn\\'t have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling .\\nI had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I\\'d make her coffee. She\\'d snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she\\'d been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I\\'d leave her apartment ten minutes before she did .\\nOne morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day\\'s floral-patterned dress, I said, \"Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it .\"\\nShe blinked. \"Okay .\"\\n\"Okay?\" I asked .\\n\"Okay,\" she repeated. \"All you had to do was ask .\" Her smile was wry .\\nI was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur .\\n\"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?\" I offered .\\nShe shook her head. \"I\\'m going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis .\"\\nIf Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. \"I\\'ll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend\\'s out of town, right?\"\\nShe smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn\\'t have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in .\\nThe suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat\\'s lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn\\'t sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn\\'t willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels .\\nThen the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again .\\n\"I couldn\\'t eat, I was so excited,\" she said. I realized eating hadn\\'t even occurred to me. She walked to the suite\\'s dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, \"Unzip me .\" I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off .\\n\"Leave the heels on,\" I said. I pulled her to me again, hip first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully .\\n\"You don\\'t have anything to do the rest of the day, right?\" she said .\\n\"I\\'m yours .\"\\nOne side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I\\'d learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. \"I want to party,\" she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. \"And let you use me. I want your release in all three holes. Think you can handle it?\"\\nI chuckled. \"I\\'m always up for a challenge .\"\\n\"Good,\" she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. \"You want some?\"\\n\" yeah,\" I said. \"It\\'s been a while. And don\\'t worry. I don\\'t get coke shaft .\"\\n\"Oh really,\" she said, never taking her eyes off her task. \"I\\'m going to test you on that. I\\'m also going to show you a little secret of mine .\"\\n\"We\\'re getting past the tip of the iceberg?\" I asked .\\n\"Definitely, and we are going deep,\" she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes .\\n\"Ladies first,\" I said .\\nKat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. \"This is so pure,\" she said. \"An old coworker can get the best blow. You\\'d like her .\"\\nI smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed .\\nShe leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun .\\nI took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good . Kat\\'s eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. \"I love on coke,\" she said. \"You better watch out .\"\\n\"You weren\\'t lying,\" I said between kisses. \"This is good .\"\\nShe undressed me and said, \"One day I might introduce you. That\\'s pretty deep into the iceberg .\"\\nWe were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. \"I\\'ve been wanting to taste you so badly,\" I said .\\nIn the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her papilla to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her private part lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips .\\n\"You want to know one of my secrets?\" I said. \"This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty private part for an hour. I have eaten a pretty private part for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you .\"\\nI dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her cherry. I flicked her cherry twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her private part, diving in as deep as I could every few moments .\\n\"I love that soft tongue,\" Kat breathed .\\nI continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her private part had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her cherry now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her private part. All I cared about was making her release. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her private part became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. \"What... what are you doing to me?\" she panted .\\nShe pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed .\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever release like that,\" she said, her eyes not leaving mine .\\n\"It\\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" I teased .\\nI cupped her chest. They were perfect small handfuls with hard papillas. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her hip. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her private part\\'s wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her papilla into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her hipprick. She didn\\'t clench her cheeks at all .\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"Give me a minute .\"\\nKat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. \"I want a line off your shaft,\" she said. \"Body blows are so much fun .\"\\nI moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. \"No, stand up,\" she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and arised by shaft to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn\\'t seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief .\\n\"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke bimbo?\" she said softly .\\nI didn\\'t have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my shaft, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my shaft in one gulp. Kat sucked shaft like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She aris ed my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down .\\n\"please,\" she begged .\\nI put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my shaft in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I\\'d hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed .\\nThis continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my shaft, with a loud slurp .\\n\"You should feel how wet you\\'ve made me,\" she said .\\nShe stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were .\\n\"You are such a shaftsucking bimbo,\" I said .\\n\"I am. I love sucking shaft so much,\" she said. \"Lie down .\"\\nShe renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I\\'d rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn\\'t long before I knew I was about to release. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting shaft. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent .\\n\"Jesus,\" I sighed .\\nKat\\'s coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my release in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed .\\n\"I love release almost as much as sucking shaft,\" she said. \"You have no idea .\"\\nMy shaft was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine .\\n\"You are checking some serious boxes for me,\" I said. \"You have no idea. A coke bimbo. A releasebimbo. What\\'s next?\" I honestly couldn\\'t believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks .\\n\"How about some Champagne?\" I suggested. \"I\\'ll order room service, too. I don\\'t want to pass the point of being able to function .\"\\nShe nestled her head into the crook of my neck. \"That sounds perfect,\" she said. \"I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach .\"\\n\"Oh, that wasn\\'t a big enough load for you?\" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne .\\n\"There is never enough release,\" she said seductively. She was in a hyper- zone .\\nThe Champagne opened with that most pleasing \"Pop!\" I picked up the phone to call room service. \"Nachos?\" I asked Kat, who still languished undressed on the bed. Her papilla poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound .\\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I love junk food when I\\'m partying .\"\\nI ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed .\\n\"The food will be here in about twenty minutes,\" I said .\\n\"Just enough recovery time,\" she said .\\nI brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service .\\n\"How\\'d you get into the party scene?\" I asked .\\n\"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station,\" she said. \"My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn\\'t the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don\\'t have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like .\"\\nI told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls\\' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch .\\nRoom service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate undressed. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures .\\nEventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. \"I\\'m going to show you a secret,\" she said .\\nI followed her swaying hip into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed .\\n\"So Kelly taught me this,\" she said, referring to her LA television friend. \"If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to hip bump it .\" She giggled .\\n\"I feel like I\\'ve heard of that,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not placing it .\"\\n\"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water,\" she explained. \"And with the high purity stuff I\\'ve been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your hip!\"\\nI chuckled. \"And how is it?\" She wasn\\'t going to get any judgment from me .\\nShe handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, \"It\\'s the most instantaneous and intense high I\\'ve ever had,\" she said. \"It makes me so horny that I almost can\\'t control myself .\"\\nKat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her hip high in the air and face in the sheets .\\n\"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger,\" she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking private part, scooped some juice out, and fingered her hipprick. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose .\\n\"Holy that\\'s the best,\" she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. \"Oh my god I need that big shaft in me. Right now .\"\\nShe didn\\'t wait for me to oblige. My shaft stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings .\\n\"I haven\\'t had a shaft this big in so long,\" she panted. \"I\\'ve just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\\'m going to release. I\\'m going to release. No one\\'s made me release like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I\\'m going to need you in my hip .\"\\nI just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn\\'t stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy .\\n\"I want to taste myself,\" she said as she licked and sucked my shaft and balls. \"That was so hot. I thought only toys could make me release like that .\"\\nShe took a firm grip of my shaft and came up to kiss me. \"Now we need to give you a turn, mister,\" she said. \"The only question is, where do you want to put it?\" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. \"You want my hip, don\\'t you?\"\\nI whispered back to her, \"Now it\\'s my turn for a secret. I\\'m an expert at anal. I\\'m a pro at making women release with my shaft in their hip. It\\'s one of my biggest points of pride .\"\\nShe smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, \"Well, I\\'m a bad girl. I\\'m a bad little anal bimbo .\"\\nLogistically, we couldn\\'t just plunge my shaft in her hip. It doesn\\'t work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair .\\nShe grabbed her little spoon again and said, \"Put a couple scoops of this on my hip,\" she said. \"Work it into me with the lube. It\\'ll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want .\"\\nI was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn\\'t about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best experience I\\'d had in years .\\nKat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke .\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"I\\'ll go slow at first .\" As I pressed the head of my shaft against her hipprick, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. \"Take a minute and get used to it,\" I told her .\\n\"I feel so full,\" she said when I bottomed out. \"It\\'s so good, John. Your shaft is perfect .\"\\nShe pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her hip cheeks. Her hip gripped my shaft the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true bimbo .\\n\"I am gonna release so hard,\" she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She\\'d never been so loud. Her hip clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her hip and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed she had usedall the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. \"Holy ,\" she said and grinned. \"Now give me that release. I need that load in my hip. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy .\"\\nI could feel my release wouldn\\'t be long, especially not with Kat\\'s deluge of filthy words urging me on .\\n\"Fill my hip up with your load,\" she begged. \"I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal bimbo .\"\\nI was so close. Looking at how my thick shaft stretched her smooth, lightly pink hipprick was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, \"You\\'re the only one who deserves this hip. My boyfriend shouldn\\'t ever be allowed to have it. Give me that release and show me you want to own this tight little hip .\"\\nThat did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man\\'s woman, and here she was begging for it. My shaft pulsed repeatedly. I don\\'t know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat\\'s enthusiasm surely helped. \"Oh god, I can feel it,\" she moaned. \" flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your hip .\"\\nWe fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. \"We should shower,\" she suggested .\\n\"I may need a bump to keep up with you,\" I said .\\n\"Or you could let me put a little in your hip,\" she said with a smile. \"You\\'ll be ready for another round in no time .\"\\n\"I am definitely open to that,\" I said. \"Maybe later .\"\\nShe laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good , and I knew I\\'d be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I\\'d had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn\\'t even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. .\\nThe coke, steamy shower, and Kat\\'s soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my shaft .\\n\"I have a lot of secrets,\" she said, \"but doing hip-to-mouth is definitely not one .\" I laughed .\\nAs afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of drink and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We have had two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could release again. It was about the intimacy .\\nSomewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, \"Where is this going?\" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep .\\nKat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn\\'t tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I\\'d rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise .\\nWhile we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that\\'s when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn\\'t been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it .\\nIt started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her hip plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more .\\n\"I\\'ve got a new task for you today,\" I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my shaft and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes .\\n\"Yes, sir?\" she said. It wasn\\'t a serious tone of submission. It was always playful .\\n\"I\\'m going to release in your hip,\" I said, matter-of-factly, \"And then plug you. So you\\'ll be plugged with an hip full of my sperm .\"\\nKat\\'s body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. \"That is so naughty,\" she said huskily. \"I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?\"\\n\"I\\'m not done,\" I said. She raised her eyebrows. \"You have to find a way to mention the word \\'plug\\' on the air .\"\\nShe laughed. \"Oh my god,\" she said. \"That is hot. I\\'ll do it .\"\\n\"I\\'ll be watching,\" I said .\\nOur frequency of anal bed time had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the hip this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal .\\nI watched Kat\\'s broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn\\'t stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, \"Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result .\"\\nMaybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. \"How did I do?\" she asked .\\n\"Perfect, baby,\" I said. \"I\\'m working on your reward right now. It\\'s going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!\"\\n\"What is it?\" she inquired .\\n\"That would ruin the surprise. But let\\'s just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu .\"\\n\\nI began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys\\' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick\\'s day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other .\\nFrom the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn\\'t really work. I wasn\\'t the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don\\'t get me wrong. I wasn\\'t bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn\\'t prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun .\\nIf the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started . It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn\\'t mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of movement their hosts .\\nI booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat .\\n\"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16,\" I instructed .\\n\"Weekend getaway?\" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji .\\n\"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?\"\\n\"For four days,\" she said .\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the details next time I see you,\" I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture .\\n\"Come over tomorrow?\" she said .\\n\\nI obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat\\'s customary undressed greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my shaft as she kissed me hello .\\n\"Okay, I have been climbing the walls,\" she said. \"You have got to tell me!\"\\n\"What have you figured out so far?\" I asked.\\n\"St. Patrick\\'s Day weekend,\" she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. \"My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can\\'t go too far .\"\\nI smiled. \"I love how smart you are,\" I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn\\'t. My excitement was too great. \"Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late .\"\\nKat squealed in delight. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you joking?\"\\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"And dinner at Joel Robuchon .\"\\nHer eyes opened wide. \"No way,\" she said. \"At MGM?\"\\nI nodded. She kissed me. \"I\\'m so wet just thinking about it,\" she said .\\n\"I haven\\'t even told you the plans yet!\" I said .\\n\"They can wait,\" she said. \"I need you inside me .\"\\nWe do it raw and hard. I didn\\'t take long to release and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth private part lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat\\'s thighs .\\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked .\\nMy tongue answered for me, as I licked her release-covered cherry .\\n\"You are such a dirty boy,\" she said. \"You filthy guy, you\\'re going to make me release .\"\\nThat wasn\\'t my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her cherry for the few moments she needed to release again. This was filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the release into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction .\\n\"I am a filthy guy,\" I said. \"I warned you about that. I\\'m your filthy guy .\"\\n\"That was hot!\" Kat said. \"I\\'m going to be craving you all day thinking about it .\"\\nAs she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. \"It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That\\'s when he\\'ll be blackout drunk. He won\\'t suspect anything,\" she said .\\n\"I would say I don\\'t care if he does,\" I said, \"but I do care. A lot. I\\'m not going to jeopardize this .\"\\nWe kissed again, then she asked softly, \"Can we get goodies in Vegas?\"\\nI smiled. \"I have an impeccable source .\"\\n\"You have everything figured out,\" she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. \"This trip is going to be really memorable, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"I\\'m pulling out all the stops,\" I said .\\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she asked .\\nI laughed and said, \"Not if you want to ruin the surprise!\"\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79628”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 49, 'cumulative_ads_count': 139, 'days': '07/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-07 14:01:24,2022-09-06 22:05:29', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,shower'}"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 938, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:05:44', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:06:01', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report .\\nA couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my shaft stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my release, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing release-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my shaft. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my shaft, begging me to fill her. Was her hip still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn\\'t long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind\\'s focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn\\'t even have her phone number .\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn\\'t have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn\\'t out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she\\'d reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted .\\nHer proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat\\'s drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself.\\nThe wait for Kat\\'s message wasn\\'t long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here .\\n\"John -- I can\\'t believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me .\\n\"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don\\'t need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love risk. Feeling your release inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I\\'ve had in years. You can\\'t imagine how excited I was, having your release in my panties. My private part was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven\\'t indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the bimboty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges .\\n\"This won\\'t all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You\\'d be surprised at all the things we\\'ll be able to do. Did you know I wear a hip plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn\\'t have them until now. And now I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to stop .\\n\"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I\\'ve always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat\"\\nTo me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn\\'t come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat\\'s apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely undressed. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her private part and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled .\\n\"You taste so sweet,\" I said .\\nShe smiled and said, \"I get so wet thinking about your shaft. I need it in me .\" She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking private part on irresistible display. \"Don\\'t be gentle,\" she said. \"And I haven\\'t done my hair yet .\"\\nI simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of hip cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, \"Harder .\" I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a chest and tweaking her papilla firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her cherry briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my shaft never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her private part. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone .\\n\"Yes! yes!\" she moaned .\\nI released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute doll. Her magic private part never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my shaft .\\n\"I own you,\" I growled. \"This is my cherry, you bimbo .\"\\n\"Yes! Yes, sir!\" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her climax building. I moved her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her private part spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her private part, flowing down my shaft and her thighs .\\nIt was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. \"Jesus, Kat, you\\'re going to make me release,\" I shouted .\\n\" that\\'s so hot,\" she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. \"Just fill me .\"\\nI closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. \"Oh, god, here it comes,\" I said. It was as if I couldn\\'t control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, \"Yes, baby!\" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my shaft in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix .\\nWe were panting. I grabbed a handful of hip again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me .\\n\"I\\'m on fire,\" she said. \"You really do own me .\"\\nI kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her private part. \"Squeeze it out,\" I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine .\"\\n\"You\\'re like a Kitty Kat when you\\'re being a bimbo like this,\" I said. \"The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night .\"\\nShe gave a soft moan and showed me the release before she swallowed. \"I like that,\" she said and paused. \"You have no idea how bad I\\'ve needed this .\" She moved to kiss me, then pulled back .\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy people I am .\"\\nWe embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too .\\n\"That was so hot,\" Kat said .\\n\"I like to be in control,\" I told her .\\n\"I need to be controlled,\" she said. \"Within reason .\"\\nI laughed and changed the subject. \"I have no idea how you\\'re going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap .\"\\nShe smiled her TV smile and said, \"Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think .\"\\nI raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at .\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bedroom. \"I\\'ll let you in on a really big secret,\" she said. \"No judgment, okay?\"\\nI nodded. \"I\\'m not in a position to judge .\"\\nShe directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above undressed heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, \"Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away .\" My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual .\\nKat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, \"It\\'s all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?\"\\nI smiled, broadly and genuinely. \"I have always loved a party girl,\" I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss .\\nI sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of release out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a pro .\\nI replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. it was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat\\'s habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke bimbo had a gravitational pull .\\nWhile Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. \"Is this the day of the week that you have your hip plug in? Or were two loads of release enough?\" I said .\\nI finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. \"There is never enough release,\" Kat replied .\\n\"That didn\\'t answer my question,\" I responded .\\n\"No,\" she answered immediately, \"it\\'s not plug day .\"\\n\"Prove it,\" I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled .\\nIt was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop .\\nAs I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again .\\n\"Satisfied?\" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her hip, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot .\\n\"Good girl,\" I wrote back. \"But not satisfied .\"\\nI silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.\\nKat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, \"But not satisfied .\" It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:\\n\"Daddy, please, I need it .\" It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her hip cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess hip plug snugly in her hip .\\nAfter that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Undressed greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent . Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn\\'t become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside .\\nTo be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn\\'t have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling .\\nI had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I\\'d make her coffee. She\\'d snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she\\'d been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I\\'d leave her apartment ten minutes before she did .\\nOne morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day\\'s floral-patterned dress, I said, \"Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it .\"\\nShe blinked. \"Okay .\"\\n\"Okay?\" I asked .\\n\"Okay,\" she repeated. \"All you had to do was ask .\" Her smile was wry .\\nI was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur .\\n\"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?\" I offered .\\nShe shook her head. \"I\\'m going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis .\"\\nIf Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. \"I\\'ll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend\\'s out of town, right?\"\\nShe smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn\\'t have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in .\\nThe suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat\\'s lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn\\'t sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn\\'t willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels .\\nThen the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again .\\n\"I couldn\\'t eat, I was so excited,\" she said. I realized eating hadn\\'t even occurred to me. She walked to the suite\\'s dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, \"Unzip me .\" I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off .\\n\"Leave the heels on,\" I said. I pulled her to me again, hip first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully .\\n\"You don\\'t have anything to do the rest of the day, right?\" she said .\\n\"I\\'m yours .\"\\nOne side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I\\'d learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. \"I want to party,\" she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. \"And let you use me. I want your release in all three holes. Think you can handle it?\"\\nI chuckled. \"I\\'m always up for a challenge .\"\\n\"Good,\" she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. \"You want some?\"\\n\" yeah,\" I said. \"It\\'s been a while. And don\\'t worry. I don\\'t get coke shaft .\"\\n\"Oh really,\" she said, never taking her eyes off her task. \"I\\'m going to test you on that. I\\'m also going to show you a little secret of mine .\"\\n\"We\\'re getting past the tip of the iceberg?\" I asked .\\n\"Definitely, and we are going deep,\" she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes .\\n\"Ladies first,\" I said .\\nKat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. \"This is so pure,\" she said. \"An old coworker can get the best blow. You\\'d like her .\"\\nI smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed .\\nShe leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun .\\nI took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good . Kat\\'s eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. \"I love on coke,\" she said. \"You better watch out .\"\\n\"You weren\\'t lying,\" I said between kisses. \"This is good .\"\\nShe undressed me and said, \"One day I might introduce you. That\\'s pretty deep into the iceberg .\"\\nWe were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. \"I\\'ve been wanting to taste you so badly,\" I said .\\nIn the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her papilla to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her private part lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips .\\n\"You want to know one of my secrets?\" I said. \"This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty private part for an hour. I have eaten a pretty private part for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you .\"\\nI dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her cherry. I flicked her cherry twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her private part, diving in as deep as I could every few moments .\\n\"I love that soft tongue,\" Kat breathed .\\nI continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her private part had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her cherry now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her private part. All I cared about was making her release. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her private part became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. \"What... what are you doing to me?\" she panted .\\nShe pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed .\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever release like that,\" she said, her eyes not leaving mine .\\n\"It\\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" I teased .\\nI cupped her chest. They were perfect small handfuls with hard papillas. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her hip. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her private part\\'s wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her papilla into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her hipprick. She didn\\'t clench her cheeks at all .\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"Give me a minute .\"\\nKat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. \"I want a line off your shaft,\" she said. \"Body blows are so much fun .\"\\nI moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. \"No, stand up,\" she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and arised by shaft to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn\\'t seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief .\\n\"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke bimbo?\" she said softly .\\nI didn\\'t have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my shaft, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my shaft in one gulp. Kat sucked shaft like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She aris ed my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down .\\n\"please,\" she begged .\\nI put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my shaft in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I\\'d hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed .\\nThis continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my shaft, with a loud slurp .\\n\"You should feel how wet you\\'ve made me,\" she said .\\nShe stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were .\\n\"You are such a shaftsucking bimbo,\" I said .\\n\"I am. I love sucking shaft so much,\" she said. \"Lie down .\"\\nShe renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I\\'d rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn\\'t long before I knew I was about to release. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting shaft. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent .\\n\"Jesus,\" I sighed .\\nKat\\'s coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my release in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed .\\n\"I love release almost as much as sucking shaft,\" she said. \"You have no idea .\"\\nMy shaft was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine .\\n\"You are checking some serious boxes for me,\" I said. \"You have no idea. A coke bimbo. A releasebimbo. What\\'s next?\" I honestly couldn\\'t believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks .\\n\"How about some Champagne?\" I suggested. \"I\\'ll order room service, too. I don\\'t want to pass the point of being able to function .\"\\nShe nestled her head into the crook of my neck. \"That sounds perfect,\" she said. \"I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach .\"\\n\"Oh, that wasn\\'t a big enough load for you?\" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne .\\n\"There is never enough release,\" she said seductively. She was in a hyper- zone .\\nThe Champagne opened with that most pleasing \"Pop!\" I picked up the phone to call room service. \"Nachos?\" I asked Kat, who still languished undressed on the bed. Her papilla poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound .\\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I love junk food when I\\'m partying .\"\\nI ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed .\\n\"The food will be here in about twenty minutes,\" I said .\\n\"Just enough recovery time,\" she said .\\nI brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service .\\n\"How\\'d you get into the party scene?\" I asked .\\n\"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station,\" she said. \"My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn\\'t the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don\\'t have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like .\"\\nI told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls\\' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch .\\nRoom service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate undressed. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures .\\nEventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. \"I\\'m going to show you a secret,\" she said .\\nI followed her swaying hip into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed .\\n\"So Kelly taught me this,\" she said, referring to her LA television friend. \"If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to hip bump it .\" She giggled .\\n\"I feel like I\\'ve heard of that,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not placing it .\"\\n\"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water,\" she explained. \"And with the high purity stuff I\\'ve been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your hip!\"\\nI chuckled. \"And how is it?\" She wasn\\'t going to get any judgment from me .\\nShe handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, \"It\\'s the most instantaneous and intense high I\\'ve ever had,\" she said. \"It makes me so horny that I almost can\\'t control myself .\"\\nKat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her hip high in the air and face in the sheets .\\n\"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger,\" she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking private part, scooped some juice out, and fingered her hipprick. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose .\\n\"Holy that\\'s the best,\" she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. \"Oh my god I need that big shaft in me. Right now .\"\\nShe didn\\'t wait for me to oblige. My shaft stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings .\\n\"I haven\\'t had a shaft this big in so long,\" she panted. \"I\\'ve just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\\'m going to release. I\\'m going to release. No one\\'s made me release like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I\\'m going to need you in my hip .\"\\nI just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn\\'t stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy .\\n\"I want to taste myself,\" she said as she licked and sucked my shaft and balls. \"That was so hot. I thought only toys could make me release like that .\"\\nShe took a firm grip of my shaft and came up to kiss me. \"Now we need to give you a turn, mister,\" she said. \"The only question is, where do you want to put it?\" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. \"You want my hip, don\\'t you?\"\\nI whispered back to her, \"Now it\\'s my turn for a secret. I\\'m an expert at anal. I\\'m a pro at making women release with my shaft in their hip. It\\'s one of my biggest points of pride .\"\\nShe smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, \"Well, I\\'m a bad girl. I\\'m a bad little anal bimbo .\"\\nLogistically, we couldn\\'t just plunge my shaft in her hip. It doesn\\'t work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair .\\nShe grabbed her little spoon again and said, \"Put a couple scoops of this on my hip,\" she said. \"Work it into me with the lube. It\\'ll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want .\"\\nI was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn\\'t about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best experience I\\'d had in years .\\nKat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke .\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"I\\'ll go slow at first .\" As I pressed the head of my shaft against her hipprick, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. \"Take a minute and get used to it,\" I told her .\\n\"I feel so full,\" she said when I bottomed out. \"It\\'s so good, John. Your shaft is perfect .\"\\nShe pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her hip cheeks. Her hip gripped my shaft the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true bimbo .\\n\"I am gonna release so hard,\" she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She\\'d never been so loud. Her hip clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her hip and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed she had usedall the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. \"Holy ,\" she said and grinned. \"Now give me that release. I need that load in my hip. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy .\"\\nI could feel my release wouldn\\'t be long, especially not with Kat\\'s deluge of filthy words urging me on .\\n\"Fill my hip up with your load,\" she begged. \"I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal bimbo .\"\\nI was so close. Looking at how my thick shaft stretched her smooth, lightly pink hipprick was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, \"You\\'re the only one who deserves this hip. My boyfriend shouldn\\'t ever be allowed to have it. Give me that release and show me you want to own this tight little hip .\"\\nThat did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man\\'s woman, and here she was begging for it. My shaft pulsed repeatedly. I don\\'t know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat\\'s enthusiasm surely helped. \"Oh god, I can feel it,\" she moaned. \" flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your hip .\"\\nWe fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. \"We should shower,\" she suggested .\\n\"I may need a bump to keep up with you,\" I said .\\n\"Or you could let me put a little in your hip,\" she said with a smile. \"You\\'ll be ready for another round in no time .\"\\n\"I am definitely open to that,\" I said. \"Maybe later .\"\\nShe laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good , and I knew I\\'d be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I\\'d had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn\\'t even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. .\\nThe coke, steamy shower, and Kat\\'s soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my shaft .\\n\"I have a lot of secrets,\" she said, \"but doing hip-to-mouth is definitely not one .\" I laughed .\\nAs afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of drink and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We have had two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could release again. It was about the intimacy .\\nSomewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, \"Where is this going?\" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep .\\nKat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn\\'t tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I\\'d rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise .\\nWhile we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that\\'s when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn\\'t been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it .\\nIt started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her hip plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more .\\n\"I\\'ve got a new task for you today,\" I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my shaft and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes .\\n\"Yes, sir?\" she said. It wasn\\'t a serious tone of submission. It was always playful .\\n\"I\\'m going to release in your hip,\" I said, matter-of-factly, \"And then plug you. So you\\'ll be plugged with an hip full of my sperm .\"\\nKat\\'s body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. \"That is so naughty,\" she said huskily. \"I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?\"\\n\"I\\'m not done,\" I said. She raised her eyebrows. \"You have to find a way to mention the word \\'plug\\' on the air .\"\\nShe laughed. \"Oh my god,\" she said. \"That is hot. I\\'ll do it .\"\\n\"I\\'ll be watching,\" I said .\\nOur frequency of anal bed time had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the hip this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal .\\nI watched Kat\\'s broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn\\'t stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, \"Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result .\"\\nMaybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. \"How did I do?\" she asked .\\n\"Perfect, baby,\" I said. \"I\\'m working on your reward right now. It\\'s going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!\"\\n\"What is it?\" she inquired .\\n\"That would ruin the surprise. But let\\'s just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu .\"\\n\\nI began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys\\' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick\\'s day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other .\\nFrom the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn\\'t really work. I wasn\\'t the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don\\'t get me wrong. I wasn\\'t bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn\\'t prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun .\\nIf the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started . It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn\\'t mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of movement their hosts .\\nI booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat .\\n\"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16,\" I instructed .\\n\"Weekend getaway?\" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji .\\n\"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?\"\\n\"For four days,\" she said .\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the details next time I see you,\" I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture .\\n\"Come over tomorrow?\" she said .\\n\\nI obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat\\'s customary undressed greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my shaft as she kissed me hello .\\n\"Okay, I have been climbing the walls,\" she said. \"You have got to tell me!\"\\n\"What have you figured out so far?\" I asked.\\n\"St. Patrick\\'s Day weekend,\" she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. \"My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can\\'t go too far .\"\\nI smiled. \"I love how smart you are,\" I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn\\'t. My excitement was too great. \"Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late .\"\\nKat squealed in delight. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you joking?\"\\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"And dinner at Joel Robuchon .\"\\nHer eyes opened wide. \"No way,\" she said. \"At MGM?\"\\nI nodded. She kissed me. \"I\\'m so wet just thinking about it,\" she said .\\n\"I haven\\'t even told you the plans yet!\" I said .\\n\"They can wait,\" she said. \"I need you inside me .\"\\nWe do it raw and hard. I didn\\'t take long to release and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth private part lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat\\'s thighs .\\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked .\\nMy tongue answered for me, as I licked her release-covered cherry .\\n\"You are such a dirty boy,\" she said. \"You filthy guy, you\\'re going to make me release .\"\\nThat wasn\\'t my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her cherry for the few moments she needed to release again. This was filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the release into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction .\\n\"I am a filthy guy,\" I said. \"I warned you about that. I\\'m your filthy guy .\"\\n\"That was hot!\" Kat said. \"I\\'m going to be craving you all day thinking about it .\"\\nAs she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. \"It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That\\'s when he\\'ll be blackout drunk. He won\\'t suspect anything,\" she said .\\n\"I would say I don\\'t care if he does,\" I said, \"but I do care. A lot. I\\'m not going to jeopardize this .\"\\nWe kissed again, then she asked softly, \"Can we get goodies in Vegas?\"\\nI smiled. \"I have an impeccable source .\"\\n\"You have everything figured out,\" she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. \"This trip is going to be really memorable, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"I\\'m pulling out all the stops,\" I said .\\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she asked .\\nI laughed and said, \"Not if you want to ruin the surprise!\"\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79628”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 49, 'cumulative_ads_count': 140, 'days': '07/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-07 14:02:10,2022-09-06 22:06:36', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,shower'}"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 938, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:06:53', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

You should listen to what i have for you before jumping into conclusion\" The man said calmly .\\n\"I don\\'t want anything from you, i know you paid me more than you\\'re supposed to but i...\" Disha was saying but stopped when she heard the man\\'s next word .\\n\"I need a nanny for my daughter and i want you to apply for it\" He said leaving her in three seconds shock .\\nA nanny?\\nFor his daughter?\\nHe has a child already?\\nWow!\\nWho would want a worker as a nanny for his daughter?\\nThis sounds crazy!\\n\"I..i why do you want me as your daughter\\'s nanny?\" Disha asked not sure of the shock she\\'s recovering from .\\nIs it the shock that he already has a child or the shock of him wanting a worker as his daughter\\'s nanny .\\n\"I just want you as my daughter\\'s nanny\" He shrugged like it\\'s nothing but she know deeply that there\\'s something behind it .\\nWhat if he wants to harm her .\\n\"I\\'m not interested!\" She said sternly before walking into the bathroom .\\nDisha walked out of the bathroom fully dressed and was not surprised when she found the creepy man gone .\\nHe must have figured out that she know of his plan .\\n\"What if i had fell for it\" She said shuddering at the thought..\\nWell..Madam Pinky would not give her to a dangerous man .\\nShe picked her bag and hurried out of the room without looking back .\\nShe got downstairs where the bar was situated and sighted Madam Pinky from afar .\\nShe walked towards the pretty woman who was in her early fifties, her short curly hair was dyed gold and her face was all made up,her lips shone with the red lip gloss she applied .\\nHer tight gown was made of leather which has tiny sparkle all over it,her shoes blinked also .\\nShe dresses that way every single day and if you don\\'t know her well enough, you\\'ll never know she\\'s a fifty plus woman .\\nShe looks far younger than her age .\\nWith her appearance,one will think she\\'s a stern woman but she\\'s so nice and down to earth .\\nShe treats her customers right which always make her bar full to the brim .\\n\"Disha\" She smiled widely as she saw Disha approaching her .\\nAmong her workers, she has a special liking for disha she knows Disha doesn\\'t like the job but she needs all the financial help she can get and that\\'s why she only calls for Disha when there are influential people around .\\n\"Madam Pinky\" Disha called .\\n\"Do you need a drink?\" Madam Pinky asked .\\n\"No\"\\n\" So..how was it?\" She asked with a little smile, knowing the lady is always unhappy after the job .\\nIf only she has the degree to get a more decent job .\\n\"He gave me much more than my pay\" Disha said .\\n\"I knew it! Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:07:09', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

I opened it and saw him looking at the two laptops on the table that was on the side. The laptop was wired to the CCTVs .\\n\"You\\'re calling me?\" why am I stuttering? He took a deep breath and stared at me. He looked at the tray I was carrying. I cleared my throat and approached his desk and landed in the vacant space there .\\nI couldn\\'t look at him so I looked around his room .\\nSofa set in front of flatscreen tv. There is a table here with a swivel chair. A king-size bed covered by a black cushion. also, black colored carpet lying on the floor. In one word. ‘Manly’ is really his room .\\nI was just standing there by his side. He leaned back in his swivel chair and he applied his back to its backrest. He looked tired but so handsome. I mean, no words can explain his appearance. There is nothing wrong with our race .\\n\"Why you are late? I cook your favorite .” He asked that I was simply tired of looking. I want to be embarrassed .\\n\"We have a practice for the prom ..\" I explained. Maybe papa will keep an eye on me. He nodded and played a game of his hand lip. I looked at his lips for a moment and immediately avoided...He smirked and licked his lips ... am I obvious?\\nHe stood up so I looked up because of his stature. He took a step towards me .\\n\"Four more nights you were late coming home .\" every step he takes forward he is my back. Gosh..what is he doing?\\nI blinked as I couldn\\'t look at him directly. Then three more thrusts..he was my back. I immediately felt the cold wall. Dead end .\\n\"Who drives you here?\" he asked seriously but I don\\'t think I heard. The noise of my heart rate overcame me more. I was just stunned when he bowed slightly so we could line up. He put his both hands on either side of my head...\\nI cursed a million in my mind. I am nervous. The speed of my heartbeat. I took a deep breath. I forgot our distance just a few feet away. The heat of her body seemed to attract me.\\n\"Distance, please! I can\\'t breathe,” I said coldly to him and pushed him slightly but he was harder he didn\\'t move .\\n\"Shall I repeat my question Roxette?\" I could hear the anger in his voice there .\\nI gritted my teeth with so much emotion. \"Why? Why are you asking? Because dad asked you? me that you should watch? Your sweet uncle then. \"\\nHis jaw clenched. The vein came out of his arm because his fist was already clenched on my side. I was nervous because of that .\\nHe leaned closer. His nose was so close to mine. Just a little movement will apply to our lips. Does he know what he is doing?\\n\"I\\'m watching you the way I want. I don\\'t need anyone else\\'s notice. Now, answer me. Who is that? Boyfriend?\"\\nI stared at him. \"he\\'s Simon. A friend, not a boyfriend. \"I focused my gaze on his lips. It was nice to pull the nape and kiss him. oh! It\\'s justice to me! Why is this handsome creature, my uncle? He suddenly bit his lips so I turned around and looked into his eyes .\\nHis hand touches my lips ..\"Who\\'s your first kiss?\" He asked huskily in a cold voice .\\nI swallowed and shook. \"Nothing yet ..\"\\nBut I remember the one on the veranda. His lips slightly touched my lips then. But just a little! I don\\'t know if it was the first kiss?\\nHe nodded briefly. \"What if ....\" he tucked some strand of my hair in my ear .\\n\"I kiss you right now? What will you do?\" He whispered that only the two of us could hear .\\nI was shocked as if my whole being shaken at what he said. What! I bit my trembling lips and looked at his lips again. hmm..inviting .. what does it taste like? So soft?\\nHis kiss on my cheek made me close and he slowly moved his lips closer to mine. My leg shook as his lips lightly touched mine. He pressed my waist. But my lips were not completely covered when there was a knock on the door .\\nI took a deep breath and pushed him. He seemed to have poured cold water on my body. Oh my god ...\\nI covered my lips as he looked up and covered his forehead as if angry .\\n\"Who\\'s that ?!\" he shouted .\\n\"Ah, Sir! ! Here\\'s what you\\'re asking for from the boutique ...\" said the maid outside the door .\\nSav walked there while I was looking for a captain because I thought I would collapse. I raised my hand on the table and rewind in my mind what happened. I heard the door close so I looked up. He has two boxes that are large and one that is small .\\nhe handed it to me. \"For you...\"\\nI blinked and took it. \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"Open it ..\"! his husky voice .. insane voice... He\\'s really my ideal man. I laid it on the table and took off the ribbon that was rolled up in the big box .\\nI gasped in surprise. It\\'s a cocktail dress!\\n\"Oh my god..it\\'s beautiful!\" I gasped in awe. How did he know that the cocktail dress was the motif at our prom? Gosh .\\nHe nodded. It was gray with glitters. That tube type but no cleavage. It\\'s just straight, not V neck. Seems like I don’t want to show my chest? It\\'s really super nice. It fits me even if I just look. I also took off the roll of a box and found those silver stilettos! nice!\\nI smiled and looked at him. \"Thank you, really!\" He bit his lip as he looked at me. A hint of amusement plastered on his face .\\n\"All for you..baby ..\"\\nChapter 6\\nIt was a big mistake. The attraction I feel for Sav. Many handsome flirts with me, but why with my uncle? What kind of heart do I have? Tsk. I buried it all in oblivion, I also don\\'t know why he moves the same way towards me? He even asked me what if he will be my first kiss?\\nWhen that incident ended two days ago. Everything became normal. Sometimes we share breakfast. He was just cold. He always has a cellphone call that he calls babe. He also comes home at night once, he is drunk. That hurts my heart, I think my heart is abnormal .\\nOf course, it\\'s wrong to like him, my uncle. That was the most painful part of me. just really unfair. But, I will try my best. So, hard to keep this feeling. I know I can find a man for me too, but I\\'m not ready yet, fling will do .\\nWe are in the MOA now. I went with my driver because I don\\'t know how to drive yet and because it\\'s still forbidden for someone like me who is seventeen years old. I really don\\'t want to go with the driver once in a while because Jezel went to see us a lot .\\nWe came from practicing folk dance at school and we went straight here because we have something to buy for tomorrow. It\\'s the last day of our practice today and our prom is coming...\\n\"Did you tell Gerald that his necktie should be gray?\" Jezel asked me. Gerald was my partner at the prom. He’s a nerd. I prefer him to the others who are too smooth. Gerald isn\\'t ugly, he\\'s really just a need to look at because of his big glasses. Gray and black is the motif of our prom. So my cocktail gown is gray so Gerald and I should have a suit .\\n\"Yep!\" I answer and look at the VS perfumes lined up. One of the perfumes in my collection. I took the night\\'s seduction and smelled it. The scent was really nice!\\n\"Will you be picked up?\"\\nI shook. \"Uncle Savier will drive me .\" note the sarcasm in uncle\\'s word. He said he would take me. He was also invited because he is one of the sponsors of St. Dominic.\\n\"Wow. The sweet one .\"\\nI stared at him. \"Shut up .\" I also choose dark red lipsticks. because my other lipstick is pink, so it\\'s different. Jezel is just next to me and asking .\\n\"Maybe they\\'re Miss Ocampo?\" I stopped at his question. Yeah, those past days. He always goes to school and picks up Miss Ocampo. Our New English school teacher. she\\'s pretty, matured, and an ideal girl. That’s why I spend time practicing to avoid being non -judgmental .\\nI have no right to get mad. Whoever he wants, I can do nothing but support him. That\\'s my role being his niece .\\n\"Who cares? They\\'re something .\" I said bitterly and took the purchases and went straight to the counter while Jez was just tailing .\\n\"E \\'why do you seem sad? Tss! I told you Rox, move on. That feeling will kill you!\" She whispered to me as I paid. After being paid I walked out. I did not answer Jez. My chest tightens. That\\'s why I\\'m avoiding it .\\n\"Rox! Sorry! Are you mad?\" Jez chased me .\\nI smiled bitterly as we exited. \"I\\'m trying Jez. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let my uncle hurt me .\" She took a deep breath and put her arm around me.\\n“Just. I’m only here when you\\'re sad. Hmm? \"\\nI rolled my eyes. \"You\\'re a drama!\"\\n\"Chee, I don\\'t know about you .\" We laughed as we got into the car. I just finished dinner and entered the room. Since I was excited about the prom I prepared everything I would need. the cocktail gown I hung on the hanger and placed in the closet. The stilleto. The makeup is all set. The earring, bracelet, and contact lens, etc. I was stunned to hear Sav’s car just arrived. It\\'s nine o\\'clock and he\\'ll just arrive?\\nI took a deep breath and thought he might not have eaten yet. So I went down because I knew the two helpers were asleep. Going down the stairs, the door suddenly opened and Sav entered, apparently drunk but still smiling. My attention was divided when I saw a woman leading him. or I must say, It’s miss Ocampo .\\nIt turned white dress with flowers. The body is curved and high heels are still on .\\n\"Where\\'s your room babe?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Where\\'s your room2x?”Tsk. Sav\\'s smile on Miss Ocampo\\'s body was so close that it gave my heart pain. Before they could go up. I sneezed .\\nThey both stopped and I saw Sav look at me seriously. no more naughtiness. Well... I\\'m just assuming too much. Why would the uncle be sweet to his niece? And when else was it legal for the uncle to kiss his niece? It\\'s a sin!\\n\"Why are you here Miss Ocampo?\" I asked formally .\\nShe suddenly formalized. \"Hmm...Sav was drunk so I supported him .\" I nodded so that Sav could almost fall asleep on her shoulder .\\n\"Any help? Because he\\'s heavy .\" She added. I had no choice but to help them. Why is he so drunk?\\n\"-Why is he drunk miss?\" I asked as Sav landed on the bed. He groaned as his back pressed against the bed. He’s just wearing a gray T-shirt and pants .\\nMiss Ocampo shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. He drank l the spirits would be like water. Hmm..by the way, does he live here?\" She asked .\\nI nodded. \"I\\'ll just get some lukewarm water .\"\\nI quickly went to the kitchen and got lukewarm water and filled it with liquor. I also took a wipe. I was annoyed because another woman entered his room. stop it Rox. He\\'s your uncle! He already has a girlfriend!\\nMy chest tightened as I went back upstairs to his bedroom. I opened the door and shuddered at where I stood. My innocent eyes! Miss Ocampo is already on Sav\\'s lap. We\\'re kissing torridly. Miss Ocampo\\'s tube dress had fallen off and Sav was already taking off his t-shirt. He held Miss Ocampo\\'s waist and caressed her butt! They were groaning and moaning...\\nI was cold and shivering as the bowl of lukewarm water I was holding collapsed. They immediately separated and stopped. Miss Ocampo immediately left Sav’s lap .\\nI didn\\'t look at them and just bowed. \"I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t know I\\'m sorry!\" I close my eyes and immediately turn around before they can see my tears. I immediately ran to my room and locked it. I ran to sit on the floor on the side of the bed and leaned back on the bed .\\nI was caught in my chest tightening and I could barely breathe. My sobs echoed in the four corners of my room. I wiped away my tears .\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be hurt!\" I built a cup on my chest. “I hate this F-feeling ! I hate my h-heart! \"\\nI was stopped by a knock on the door from outside. \"Rox! Open the door!\" Sav\\'s hoarse cry. Only in its voice will you know that it has been drunk .\\nI remained silent and sobbed. I was speechless. I\\'ve seen him bring a woman here a few times but it hurts more to see what they\\'re doing .\\nI stopped and was even more nervous when the door suddenly opened. What? I locked it! Sav came in, still topless and holding a key. That\\'s why. I averted my eyes when I saw his anticipating look. His eyes were bulging and he was obviously drunk. I can’t look at his handsome body and has eight abs. Darn. He took a deep breath and I could see his footsteps approaching .\\nI closed my eyes firmly with my heart pounding. the crash that I only feel when he\\'s there. His effect on my heart was really strange. This is so bad. He bowed in front of me. One knee was kneeling on the floor and the other was raised and placed his arm there .\\n\"Let\\'s talk,\" he said hoarsely. I immediately inhaled the smell of his breath mixed with mint and liquor. I opened my eyes and my tears flowed. His palm rose and wiped away my tears which I immediately avoided .\\n\"Don\\'t touch me. Just talk .\" I said coldly .\\nHe heaved and sighed. \"Okay ..\" he raised his hand to my side. I hugged my knee .\\n\"Why did you follow? What about your girlfriend?\" I asked. It was hoarse from crying and trembling .\\n\"Who won\\'t follow if you\\'re crying?\" He insisted. His jaw clamped dangerously. He seemed to have lost his drunkenness .\\n“You care ?!” I Spat. \"Don\\'t pretend, please. I\\'m fine. Go away .\" New tears flowed. I bit my trembling lips .\\n\"Why are you crying?\" Instead, he asked. Why? Should I tell the truth? It was as if I had just put myself in harm\\'s way .\\n\"Go aways! you dirty man! Go away! \"I shouted and slapped him on the face and chest. I didn\\'t care if his handsome face got hurt. He didn\\'t stop me, he just let me go. Until I got tired of the beating. His face was red. and I did not even bear my blow to him. He\\'s massive and strong. So maybe that\\'s just not in him .\\n\"You\\'re done?\" He parted the strand of hair on my face. I shunned .\\n\"I hate you!\"\\nHe nodded .\\n\"Why are you crying? May I know why?\" He asked softly .\\n\"Because I hate you,\" I answered immediately. He grabbed my chin and faced him. His dark and expressive eyes were really beautiful. The thick eyebrows and sharp nose. His naturally red lips. He\\'s perfect .\\n\"Hating your uncle is normal. Do you know what\\'s wrong? the wrong is if you love more than a normal love. Not as an uncle, but as a man. ” I stiffened in my seat .\\nThose past years there was no such partnership with us. He always makes business trips abroad. And busy at work. I bit my lip and bowed. My chest is pounding. What does he mean? Am I too obvious?\\n“Did you know I’m ready to fight the whole world for someone? Do you know I’m just waiting for the chance to let her know how I feel? I will fight for us. Even if this family breaks up. \" He said seriously. He looked straight into my eyes .\\n\"W-What are you saying?\" I whispered .\\nHe leaned closer and kissed my forehead and my nose ... then he stops. \"If I will ask you, to run away with me... Would you?\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79577\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:07:25', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 91, 'cumulative_ads_count': 91, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:07:40', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:07:56', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya.

Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:08:29', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child .

Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 938, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:08:44', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report .\\nA couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my shaft stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my release, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing release-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my shaft. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my shaft, begging me to fill her. Was her hip still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn\\'t long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind\\'s focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn\\'t even have her phone number .\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn\\'t have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn\\'t out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she\\'d reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted .\\nHer proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat\\'s drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself.\\nThe wait for Kat\\'s message wasn\\'t long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here .\\n\"John -- I can\\'t believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me .\\n\"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don\\'t need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love risk. Feeling your release inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I\\'ve had in years. You can\\'t imagine how excited I was, having your release in my panties. My private part was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven\\'t indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the bimboty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges .\\n\"This won\\'t all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You\\'d be surprised at all the things we\\'ll be able to do. Did you know I wear a hip plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn\\'t have them until now. And now I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to stop .\\n\"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I\\'ve always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat\"\\nTo me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn\\'t come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat\\'s apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely undressed. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her private part and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled .\\n\"You taste so sweet,\" I said .\\nShe smiled and said, \"I get so wet thinking about your shaft. I need it in me .\" She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking private part on irresistible display. \"Don\\'t be gentle,\" she said. \"And I haven\\'t done my hair yet .\"\\nI simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of hip cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, \"Harder .\" I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a chest and tweaking her papilla firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her cherry briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my shaft never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her private part. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone .\\n\"Yes! yes!\" she moaned .\\nI released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute doll. Her magic private part never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my shaft .\\n\"I own you,\" I growled. \"This is my cherry, you bimbo .\"\\n\"Yes! Yes, sir!\" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her climax building. I moved her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her private part spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her private part, flowing down my shaft and her thighs .\\nIt was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. \"Jesus, Kat, you\\'re going to make me release,\" I shouted .\\n\" that\\'s so hot,\" she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. \"Just fill me .\"\\nI closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. \"Oh, god, here it comes,\" I said. It was as if I couldn\\'t control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, \"Yes, baby!\" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my shaft in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix .\\nWe were panting. I grabbed a handful of hip again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me .\\n\"I\\'m on fire,\" she said. \"You really do own me .\"\\nI kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her private part. \"Squeeze it out,\" I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine .\"\\n\"You\\'re like a Kitty Kat when you\\'re being a bimbo like this,\" I said. \"The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night .\"\\nShe gave a soft moan and showed me the release before she swallowed. \"I like that,\" she said and paused. \"You have no idea how bad I\\'ve needed this .\" She moved to kiss me, then pulled back .\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy people I am .\"\\nWe embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too .\\n\"That was so hot,\" Kat said .\\n\"I like to be in control,\" I told her .\\n\"I need to be controlled,\" she said. \"Within reason .\"\\nI laughed and changed the subject. \"I have no idea how you\\'re going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap .\"\\nShe smiled her TV smile and said, \"Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think .\"\\nI raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at .\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bedroom. \"I\\'ll let you in on a really big secret,\" she said. \"No judgment, okay?\"\\nI nodded. \"I\\'m not in a position to judge .\"\\nShe directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above undressed heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, \"Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away .\" My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual .\\nKat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, \"It\\'s all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?\"\\nI smiled, broadly and genuinely. \"I have always loved a party girl,\" I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss .\\nI sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of release out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a pro .\\nI replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. it was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat\\'s habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke bimbo had a gravitational pull .\\nWhile Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. \"Is this the day of the week that you have your hip plug in? Or were two loads of release enough?\" I said .\\nI finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. \"There is never enough release,\" Kat replied .\\n\"That didn\\'t answer my question,\" I responded .\\n\"No,\" she answered immediately, \"it\\'s not plug day .\"\\n\"Prove it,\" I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled .\\nIt was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop .\\nAs I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again .\\n\"Satisfied?\" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her hip, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot .\\n\"Good girl,\" I wrote back. \"But not satisfied .\"\\nI silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.\\nKat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, \"But not satisfied .\" It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:\\n\"Daddy, please, I need it .\" It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her hip cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess hip plug snugly in her hip .\\nAfter that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Undressed greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent . Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn\\'t become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside .\\nTo be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn\\'t have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling .\\nI had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I\\'d make her coffee. She\\'d snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she\\'d been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I\\'d leave her apartment ten minutes before she did .\\nOne morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day\\'s floral-patterned dress, I said, \"Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it .\"\\nShe blinked. \"Okay .\"\\n\"Okay?\" I asked .\\n\"Okay,\" she repeated. \"All you had to do was ask .\" Her smile was wry .\\nI was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur .\\n\"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?\" I offered .\\nShe shook her head. \"I\\'m going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis .\"\\nIf Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. \"I\\'ll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend\\'s out of town, right?\"\\nShe smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn\\'t have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in .\\nThe suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat\\'s lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn\\'t sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn\\'t willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels .\\nThen the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again .\\n\"I couldn\\'t eat, I was so excited,\" she said. I realized eating hadn\\'t even occurred to me. She walked to the suite\\'s dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, \"Unzip me .\" I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off .\\n\"Leave the heels on,\" I said. I pulled her to me again, hip first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully .\\n\"You don\\'t have anything to do the rest of the day, right?\" she said .\\n\"I\\'m yours .\"\\nOne side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I\\'d learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. \"I want to party,\" she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. \"And let you use me. I want your release in all three holes. Think you can handle it?\"\\nI chuckled. \"I\\'m always up for a challenge .\"\\n\"Good,\" she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. \"You want some?\"\\n\" yeah,\" I said. \"It\\'s been a while. And don\\'t worry. I don\\'t get coke shaft .\"\\n\"Oh really,\" she said, never taking her eyes off her task. \"I\\'m going to test you on that. I\\'m also going to show you a little secret of mine .\"\\n\"We\\'re getting past the tip of the iceberg?\" I asked .\\n\"Definitely, and we are going deep,\" she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes .\\n\"Ladies first,\" I said .\\nKat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. \"This is so pure,\" she said. \"An old coworker can get the best blow. You\\'d like her .\"\\nI smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed .\\nShe leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun .\\nI took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good . Kat\\'s eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. \"I love on coke,\" she said. \"You better watch out .\"\\n\"You weren\\'t lying,\" I said between kisses. \"This is good .\"\\nShe undressed me and said, \"One day I might introduce you. That\\'s pretty deep into the iceberg .\"\\nWe were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. \"I\\'ve been wanting to taste you so badly,\" I said .\\nIn the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her papilla to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her private part lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips .\\n\"You want to know one of my secrets?\" I said. \"This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty private part for an hour. I have eaten a pretty private part for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you .\"\\nI dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her cherry. I flicked her cherry twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her private part, diving in as deep as I could every few moments .\\n\"I love that soft tongue,\" Kat breathed .\\nI continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her private part had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her cherry now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her private part. All I cared about was making her release. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her private part became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. \"What... what are you doing to me?\" she panted .\\nShe pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed .\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever release like that,\" she said, her eyes not leaving mine .\\n\"It\\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" I teased .\\nI cupped her chest. They were perfect small handfuls with hard papillas. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her hip. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her private part\\'s wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her papilla into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her hipprick. She didn\\'t clench her cheeks at all .\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"Give me a minute .\"\\nKat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. \"I want a line off your shaft,\" she said. \"Body blows are so much fun .\"\\nI moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. \"No, stand up,\" she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and arised by shaft to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn\\'t seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief .\\n\"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke bimbo?\" she said softly .\\nI didn\\'t have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my shaft, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my shaft in one gulp. Kat sucked shaft like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She aris ed my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down .\\n\"please,\" she begged .\\nI put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my shaft in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I\\'d hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed .\\nThis continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my shaft, with a loud slurp .\\n\"You should feel how wet you\\'ve made me,\" she said .\\nShe stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were .\\n\"You are such a shaftsucking bimbo,\" I said .\\n\"I am. I love sucking shaft so much,\" she said. \"Lie down .\"\\nShe renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I\\'d rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn\\'t long before I knew I was about to release. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting shaft. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent .\\n\"Jesus,\" I sighed .\\nKat\\'s coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my release in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed .\\n\"I love release almost as much as sucking shaft,\" she said. \"You have no idea .\"\\nMy shaft was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine .\\n\"You are checking some serious boxes for me,\" I said. \"You have no idea. A coke bimbo. A releasebimbo. What\\'s next?\" I honestly couldn\\'t believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks .\\n\"How about some Champagne?\" I suggested. \"I\\'ll order room service, too. I don\\'t want to pass the point of being able to function .\"\\nShe nestled her head into the crook of my neck. \"That sounds perfect,\" she said. \"I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach .\"\\n\"Oh, that wasn\\'t a big enough load for you?\" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne .\\n\"There is never enough release,\" she said seductively. She was in a hyper- zone .\\nThe Champagne opened with that most pleasing \"Pop!\" I picked up the phone to call room service. \"Nachos?\" I asked Kat, who still languished undressed on the bed. Her papilla poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound .\\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I love junk food when I\\'m partying .\"\\nI ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed .\\n\"The food will be here in about twenty minutes,\" I said .\\n\"Just enough recovery time,\" she said .\\nI brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service .\\n\"How\\'d you get into the party scene?\" I asked .\\n\"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station,\" she said. \"My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn\\'t the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don\\'t have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like .\"\\nI told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls\\' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch .\\nRoom service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate undressed. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures .\\nEventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. \"I\\'m going to show you a secret,\" she said .\\nI followed her swaying hip into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed .\\n\"So Kelly taught me this,\" she said, referring to her LA television friend. \"If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to hip bump it .\" She giggled .\\n\"I feel like I\\'ve heard of that,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not placing it .\"\\n\"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water,\" she explained. \"And with the high purity stuff I\\'ve been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your hip!\"\\nI chuckled. \"And how is it?\" She wasn\\'t going to get any judgment from me .\\nShe handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, \"It\\'s the most instantaneous and intense high I\\'ve ever had,\" she said. \"It makes me so horny that I almost can\\'t control myself .\"\\nKat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her hip high in the air and face in the sheets .\\n\"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger,\" she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking private part, scooped some juice out, and fingered her hipprick. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose .\\n\"Holy that\\'s the best,\" she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. \"Oh my god I need that big shaft in me. Right now .\"\\nShe didn\\'t wait for me to oblige. My shaft stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings .\\n\"I haven\\'t had a shaft this big in so long,\" she panted. \"I\\'ve just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\\'m going to release. I\\'m going to release. No one\\'s made me release like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I\\'m going to need you in my hip .\"\\nI just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn\\'t stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy .\\n\"I want to taste myself,\" she said as she licked and sucked my shaft and balls. \"That was so hot. I thought only toys could make me release like that .\"\\nShe took a firm grip of my shaft and came up to kiss me. \"Now we need to give you a turn, mister,\" she said. \"The only question is, where do you want to put it?\" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. \"You want my hip, don\\'t you?\"\\nI whispered back to her, \"Now it\\'s my turn for a secret. I\\'m an expert at anal. I\\'m a pro at making women release with my shaft in their hip. It\\'s one of my biggest points of pride .\"\\nShe smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, \"Well, I\\'m a bad girl. I\\'m a bad little anal bimbo .\"\\nLogistically, we couldn\\'t just plunge my shaft in her hip. It doesn\\'t work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair .\\nShe grabbed her little spoon again and said, \"Put a couple scoops of this on my hip,\" she said. \"Work it into me with the lube. It\\'ll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want .\"\\nI was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn\\'t about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best experience I\\'d had in years .\\nKat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke .\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"I\\'ll go slow at first .\" As I pressed the head of my shaft against her hipprick, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. \"Take a minute and get used to it,\" I told her .\\n\"I feel so full,\" she said when I bottomed out. \"It\\'s so good, John. Your shaft is perfect .\"\\nShe pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her hip cheeks. Her hip gripped my shaft the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true bimbo .\\n\"I am gonna release so hard,\" she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She\\'d never been so loud. Her hip clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her hip and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed she had usedall the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. \"Holy ,\" she said and grinned. \"Now give me that release. I need that load in my hip. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy .\"\\nI could feel my release wouldn\\'t be long, especially not with Kat\\'s deluge of filthy words urging me on .\\n\"Fill my hip up with your load,\" she begged. \"I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal bimbo .\"\\nI was so close. Looking at how my thick shaft stretched her smooth, lightly pink hipprick was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, \"You\\'re the only one who deserves this hip. My boyfriend shouldn\\'t ever be allowed to have it. Give me that release and show me you want to own this tight little hip .\"\\nThat did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man\\'s woman, and here she was begging for it. My shaft pulsed repeatedly. I don\\'t know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat\\'s enthusiasm surely helped. \"Oh god, I can feel it,\" she moaned. \" flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your hip .\"\\nWe fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. \"We should shower,\" she suggested .\\n\"I may need a bump to keep up with you,\" I said .\\n\"Or you could let me put a little in your hip,\" she said with a smile. \"You\\'ll be ready for another round in no time .\"\\n\"I am definitely open to that,\" I said. \"Maybe later .\"\\nShe laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good , and I knew I\\'d be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I\\'d had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn\\'t even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. .\\nThe coke, steamy shower, and Kat\\'s soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my shaft .\\n\"I have a lot of secrets,\" she said, \"but doing hip-to-mouth is definitely not one .\" I laughed .\\nAs afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of drink and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We have had two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could release again. It was about the intimacy .\\nSomewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, \"Where is this going?\" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep .\\nKat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn\\'t tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I\\'d rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise .\\nWhile we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that\\'s when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn\\'t been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it .\\nIt started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her hip plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more .\\n\"I\\'ve got a new task for you today,\" I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my shaft and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes .\\n\"Yes, sir?\" she said. It wasn\\'t a serious tone of submission. It was always playful .\\n\"I\\'m going to release in your hip,\" I said, matter-of-factly, \"And then plug you. So you\\'ll be plugged with an hip full of my sperm .\"\\nKat\\'s body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. \"That is so naughty,\" she said huskily. \"I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?\"\\n\"I\\'m not done,\" I said. She raised her eyebrows. \"You have to find a way to mention the word \\'plug\\' on the air .\"\\nShe laughed. \"Oh my god,\" she said. \"That is hot. I\\'ll do it .\"\\n\"I\\'ll be watching,\" I said .\\nOur frequency of anal bed time had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the hip this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal .\\nI watched Kat\\'s broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn\\'t stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, \"Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result .\"\\nMaybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. \"How did I do?\" she asked .\\n\"Perfect, baby,\" I said. \"I\\'m working on your reward right now. It\\'s going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!\"\\n\"What is it?\" she inquired .\\n\"That would ruin the surprise. But let\\'s just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu .\"\\n\\nI began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys\\' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick\\'s day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other .\\nFrom the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn\\'t really work. I wasn\\'t the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don\\'t get me wrong. I wasn\\'t bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn\\'t prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun .\\nIf the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started . It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn\\'t mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of movement their hosts .\\nI booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat .\\n\"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16,\" I instructed .\\n\"Weekend getaway?\" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji .\\n\"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?\"\\n\"For four days,\" she said .\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the details next time I see you,\" I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture .\\n\"Come over tomorrow?\" she said .\\n\\nI obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat\\'s customary undressed greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my shaft as she kissed me hello .\\n\"Okay, I have been climbing the walls,\" she said. \"You have got to tell me!\"\\n\"What have you figured out so far?\" I asked.\\n\"St. Patrick\\'s Day weekend,\" she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. \"My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can\\'t go too far .\"\\nI smiled. \"I love how smart you are,\" I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn\\'t. My excitement was too great. \"Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late .\"\\nKat squealed in delight. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you joking?\"\\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"And dinner at Joel Robuchon .\"\\nHer eyes opened wide. \"No way,\" she said. \"At MGM?\"\\nI nodded. She kissed me. \"I\\'m so wet just thinking about it,\" she said .\\n\"I haven\\'t even told you the plans yet!\" I said .\\n\"They can wait,\" she said. \"I need you inside me .\"\\nWe do it raw and hard. I didn\\'t take long to release and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth private part lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat\\'s thighs .\\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked .\\nMy tongue answered for me, as I licked her release-covered cherry .\\n\"You are such a dirty boy,\" she said. \"You filthy guy, you\\'re going to make me release .\"\\nThat wasn\\'t my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her cherry for the few moments she needed to release again. This was filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the release into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction .\\n\"I am a filthy guy,\" I said. \"I warned you about that. I\\'m your filthy guy .\"\\n\"That was hot!\" Kat said. \"I\\'m going to be craving you all day thinking about it .\"\\nAs she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. \"It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That\\'s when he\\'ll be blackout drunk. He won\\'t suspect anything,\" she said .\\n\"I would say I don\\'t care if he does,\" I said, \"but I do care. A lot. I\\'m not going to jeopardize this .\"\\nWe kissed again, then she asked softly, \"Can we get goodies in Vegas?\"\\nI smiled. \"I have an impeccable source .\"\\n\"You have everything figured out,\" she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. \"This trip is going to be really memorable, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"I\\'m pulling out all the stops,\" I said .\\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she asked .\\nI laughed and said, \"Not if you want to ruin the surprise!\"\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79628”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 49, 'cumulative_ads_count': 140, 'days': '07/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-07 14:06:14,2022-09-06 22:09:01', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,shower'}\n"

She left even before her case was tried .\"\\n\"I know Katerina, she must have left for a reason, Ryegrass .\"\\n\"Who I\\'m I to inject my opinion? She is your mate and the bond between the both of you was very strong .\"\\nWoods moved away from Ryegrass a bit. He wasn\\'t feeling comfortable around him and couldn\\'t figure out why .\\nHis late father had once told him, \"anytime you feel uncomfortable around a werewolf, be very careful .\"\\nHis father may be dead but he connects to him one way or the other through a mind link .\\n\"Go on with your haunting Ryegrass I shall see you tomorrow .\"\\nHis words were final. Ryegrass left immediately transforming and running into the forest .\\n\"He seems harmless, father .\"\\n\"I told you not to trust anyone, I told you .\"\\nThe voice of his father echoed to him through a mind link .\\nHe transformed back into a werewolf and ran into the thickness of the forest .\\n***********************\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\" the head witch laughed out boastfully .\\n\"I shall take my revenge. Yes, I shall take my revenge on all of them until they\\'re wiped out completely .\"\\n\"But why take revenge on the innocent?\" Aquila asked. She sounded pitiful .\\n\"Be quiet for you know nothing .\" The head witch retorted .\\n\"I know the story. Their forest fathers are the ones guilty .\"\\n\"Oh, my dear Aquila, you are just like your mother naive and stupid .\"\\n\"Do not insult my mother .\"\\n\"How dare you talk back at me?\" The head witch asked her, pointing at her .\"\\n\"For this,\" she continued, \"I shall cast a spell upon you .\"\\nShe moved close to Aquila and touched her with her wand .\\nAquila lost the ability to communicate using the mind link instantly .\\n\"Why did you do that?\" one of the other witches asked .\\n\"I don\\'t trust her, she might expose us .\"\\n\"Is this war really necessary? It\\'s been over decades since the incident happened. The present settlers are only living on instructions passed by their fathers, who also obeyed their fathers .\"\\n\"You lost your mother to them have you forgotten? My mother too and even Aquila\\'s mother. Isn\\'t that enough reason for her not to be nice to these creatures called werewolves?\"\\nShe paused as though she remembered something she had forgotten to say .\\n\"These creatures do not like us, they call us evil. Any attempt to play near their territory will get you killed. Only a few have survived it in the past .\"\\n\"Show her mercy. Undo the spell .\" Another witch suggested .\\n\"Not yet, let her remain that way for a day or two. She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 91, 'cumulative_ads_count': 91, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:09:16', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

She left even before her case was tried .\"\\n\"I know Katerina, she must have left for a reason, Ryegrass .\"\\n\"Who I\\'m I to inject my opinion? She is your mate and the bond between the both of you was very strong .\"\\nWoods moved away from Ryegrass a bit. He wasn\\'t feeling comfortable around him and couldn\\'t figure out why .\\nHis late father had once told him, \"anytime you feel uncomfortable around a werewolf, be very careful .\"\\nHis father may be dead but he connects to him one way or the other through a mind link .\\n\"Go on with your haunting Ryegrass I shall see you tomorrow .\"\\nHis words were final. Ryegrass left immediately transforming and running into the forest .\\n\"He seems harmless, father .\"\\n\"I told you not to trust anyone, I told you .\"\\nThe voice of his father echoed to him through a mind link .\\nHe transformed back into a werewolf and ran into the thickness of the forest .\\n***********************\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\" the head witch laughed out boastfully .\\n\"I shall take my revenge. Yes, I shall take my revenge on all of them until they\\'re wiped out completely .\"\\n\"But why take revenge on the innocent?\" Aquila asked. She sounded pitiful .\\n\"Be quiet for you know nothing .\" The head witch retorted .\\n\"I know the story. Their forest fathers are the ones guilty .\"\\n\"Oh, my dear Aquila, you are just like your mother naive and stupid .\"\\n\"Do not insult my mother .\"\\n\"How dare you talk back at me?\" The head witch asked her, pointing at her .\"\\n\"For this,\" she continued, \"I shall cast a spell upon you .\"\\nShe moved close to Aquila and touched her with her wand .\\nAquila lost the ability to communicate using the mind link instantly .\\n\"Why did you do that?\" one of the other witches asked .\\n\"I don\\'t trust her, she might expose us .\"\\n\"Is this war really necessary? It\\'s been over decades since the incident happened. The present settlers are only living on instructions passed by their fathers, who also obeyed their fathers .\"\\n\"You lost your mother to them have you forgotten? My mother too and even Aquila\\'s mother. Isn\\'t that enough reason for her not to be nice to these creatures called werewolves?\"\\nShe paused as though she remembered something she had forgotten to say .\\n\"These creatures do not like us, they call us evil. Any attempt to play near their territory will get you killed. Only a few have survived it in the past .\"\\n\"Show her mercy. Undo the spell .\" Another witch suggested .\\n\"Not yet, let her remain that way for a day or two. She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 91, 'cumulative_ads_count': 91, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:09:32', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report .\\nA couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my shaft stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my release, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing release-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my shaft. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my shaft, begging me to fill her. Was her hip still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn\\'t long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind\\'s focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn\\'t even have her phone number .\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn\\'t have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn\\'t out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she\\'d reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted .\\nHer proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat\\'s drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself.\\nThe wait for Kat\\'s message wasn\\'t long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here .\\n\"John -- I can\\'t believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me .\\n\"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don\\'t need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love risk. Feeling your release inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I\\'ve had in years. You can\\'t imagine how excited I was, having your release in my panties. My private part was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven\\'t indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the bimboty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges .\\n\"This won\\'t all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You\\'d be surprised at all the things we\\'ll be able to do. Did you know I wear a hip plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn\\'t have them until now. And now I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to stop .\\n\"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I\\'ve always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat\"\\nTo me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn\\'t come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat\\'s apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely undressed. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her private part and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled .\\n\"You taste so sweet,\" I said .\\nShe smiled and said, \"I get so wet thinking about your shaft. I need it in me .\" She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking private part on irresistible display. \"Don\\'t be gentle,\" she said. \"And I haven\\'t done my hair yet .\"\\nI simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of hip cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, \"Harder .\" I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a chest and tweaking her papilla firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her cherry briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my shaft never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her private part. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone .\\n\"Yes! yes!\" she moaned .\\nI released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute doll. Her magic private part never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my shaft .\\n\"I own you,\" I growled. \"This is my cherry, you bimbo .\"\\n\"Yes! Yes, sir!\" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her climax building. I moved her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her private part spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her private part, flowing down my shaft and her thighs .\\nIt was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. \"Jesus, Kat, you\\'re going to make me release,\" I shouted .\\n\" that\\'s so hot,\" she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. \"Just fill me .\"\\nI closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. \"Oh, god, here it comes,\" I said. It was as if I couldn\\'t control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, \"Yes, baby!\" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my shaft in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix .\\nWe were panting. I grabbed a handful of hip again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me .\\n\"I\\'m on fire,\" she said. \"You really do own me .\"\\nI kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her private part. \"Squeeze it out,\" I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine .\"\\n\"You\\'re like a Kitty Kat when you\\'re being a bimbo like this,\" I said. \"The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night .\"\\nShe gave a soft moan and showed me the release before she swallowed. \"I like that,\" she said and paused. \"You have no idea how bad I\\'ve needed this .\" She moved to kiss me, then pulled back .\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy people I am .\"\\nWe embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too .\\n\"That was so hot,\" Kat said .\\n\"I like to be in control,\" I told her .\\n\"I need to be controlled,\" she said. \"Within reason .\"\\nI laughed and changed the subject. \"I have no idea how you\\'re going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap .\"\\nShe smiled her TV smile and said, \"Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think .\"\\nI raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at .\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bedroom. \"I\\'ll let you in on a really big secret,\" she said. \"No judgment, okay?\"\\nI nodded. \"I\\'m not in a position to judge .\"\\nShe directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above undressed heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, \"Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away .\" My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual .\\nKat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, \"It\\'s all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?\"\\nI smiled, broadly and genuinely. \"I have always loved a party girl,\" I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss .\\nI sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of release out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a pro .\\nI replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. it was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat\\'s habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke bimbo had a gravitational pull .\\nWhile Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. \"Is this the day of the week that you have your hip plug in? Or were two loads of release enough?\" I said .\\nI finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. \"There is never enough release,\" Kat replied .\\n\"That didn\\'t answer my question,\" I responded .\\n\"No,\" she answered immediately, \"it\\'s not plug day .\"\\n\"Prove it,\" I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled .\\nIt was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop .\\nAs I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again .\\n\"Satisfied?\" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her hip, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot .\\n\"Good girl,\" I wrote back. \"But not satisfied .\"\\nI silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.\\nKat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, \"But not satisfied .\" It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:\\n\"Daddy, please, I need it .\" It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her hip cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess hip plug snugly in her hip .\\nAfter that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Undressed greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent . Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn\\'t become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside .\\nTo be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn\\'t have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling .\\nI had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I\\'d make her coffee. She\\'d snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she\\'d been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I\\'d leave her apartment ten minutes before she did .\\nOne morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day\\'s floral-patterned dress, I said, \"Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it .\"\\nShe blinked. \"Okay .\"\\n\"Okay?\" I asked .\\n\"Okay,\" she repeated. \"All you had to do was ask .\" Her smile was wry .\\nI was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur .\\n\"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?\" I offered .\\nShe shook her head. \"I\\'m going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis .\"\\nIf Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. \"I\\'ll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend\\'s out of town, right?\"\\nShe smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn\\'t have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in .\\nThe suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat\\'s lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn\\'t sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn\\'t willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels .\\nThen the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again .\\n\"I couldn\\'t eat, I was so excited,\" she said. I realized eating hadn\\'t even occurred to me. She walked to the suite\\'s dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, \"Unzip me .\" I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off .\\n\"Leave the heels on,\" I said. I pulled her to me again, hip first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully .\\n\"You don\\'t have anything to do the rest of the day, right?\" she said .\\n\"I\\'m yours .\"\\nOne side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I\\'d learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. \"I want to party,\" she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. \"And let you use me. I want your release in all three holes. Think you can handle it?\"\\nI chuckled. \"I\\'m always up for a challenge .\"\\n\"Good,\" she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. \"You want some?\"\\n\" yeah,\" I said. \"It\\'s been a while. And don\\'t worry. I don\\'t get coke shaft .\"\\n\"Oh really,\" she said, never taking her eyes off her task. \"I\\'m going to test you on that. I\\'m also going to show you a little secret of mine .\"\\n\"We\\'re getting past the tip of the iceberg?\" I asked .\\n\"Definitely, and we are going deep,\" she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes .\\n\"Ladies first,\" I said .\\nKat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. \"This is so pure,\" she said. \"An old coworker can get the best blow. You\\'d like her .\"\\nI smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed .\\nShe leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun .\\nI took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good . Kat\\'s eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. \"I love on coke,\" she said. \"You better watch out .\"\\n\"You weren\\'t lying,\" I said between kisses. \"This is good .\"\\nShe undressed me and said, \"One day I might introduce you. That\\'s pretty deep into the iceberg .\"\\nWe were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. \"I\\'ve been wanting to taste you so badly,\" I said .\\nIn the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her papilla to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her private part lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips .\\n\"You want to know one of my secrets?\" I said. \"This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty private part for an hour. I have eaten a pretty private part for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you .\"\\nI dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her cherry. I flicked her cherry twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her private part, diving in as deep as I could every few moments .\\n\"I love that soft tongue,\" Kat breathed .\\nI continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her private part had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her cherry now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her private part. All I cared about was making her release. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her private part became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. \"What... what are you doing to me?\" she panted .\\nShe pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed .\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever release like that,\" she said, her eyes not leaving mine .\\n\"It\\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" I teased .\\nI cupped her chest. They were perfect small handfuls with hard papillas. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her hip. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her private part\\'s wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her papilla into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her hipprick. She didn\\'t clench her cheeks at all .\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"Give me a minute .\"\\nKat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. \"I want a line off your shaft,\" she said. \"Body blows are so much fun .\"\\nI moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. \"No, stand up,\" she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and arised by shaft to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn\\'t seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief .\\n\"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke bimbo?\" she said softly .\\nI didn\\'t have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my shaft, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my shaft in one gulp. Kat sucked shaft like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She aris ed my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down .\\n\"please,\" she begged .\\nI put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my shaft in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I\\'d hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed .\\nThis continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my shaft, with a loud slurp .\\n\"You should feel how wet you\\'ve made me,\" she said .\\nShe stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were .\\n\"You are such a shaftsucking bimbo,\" I said .\\n\"I am. I love sucking shaft so much,\" she said. \"Lie down .\"\\nShe renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I\\'d rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn\\'t long before I knew I was about to release. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting shaft. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent .\\n\"Jesus,\" I sighed .\\nKat\\'s coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my release in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed .\\n\"I love release almost as much as sucking shaft,\" she said. \"You have no idea .\"\\nMy shaft was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine .\\n\"You are checking some serious boxes for me,\" I said. \"You have no idea. A coke bimbo. A releasebimbo. What\\'s next?\" I honestly couldn\\'t believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks .\\n\"How about some Champagne?\" I suggested. \"I\\'ll order room service, too. I don\\'t want to pass the point of being able to function .\"\\nShe nestled her head into the crook of my neck. \"That sounds perfect,\" she said. \"I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach .\"\\n\"Oh, that wasn\\'t a big enough load for you?\" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne .\\n\"There is never enough release,\" she said seductively. She was in a hyper- zone .\\nThe Champagne opened with that most pleasing \"Pop!\" I picked up the phone to call room service. \"Nachos?\" I asked Kat, who still languished undressed on the bed. Her papilla poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound .\\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I love junk food when I\\'m partying .\"\\nI ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed .\\n\"The food will be here in about twenty minutes,\" I said .\\n\"Just enough recovery time,\" she said .\\nI brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service .\\n\"How\\'d you get into the party scene?\" I asked .\\n\"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station,\" she said. \"My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn\\'t the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don\\'t have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like .\"\\nI told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls\\' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch .\\nRoom service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate undressed. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures .\\nEventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. \"I\\'m going to show you a secret,\" she said .\\nI followed her swaying hip into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed .\\n\"So Kelly taught me this,\" she said, referring to her LA television friend. \"If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to hip bump it .\" She giggled .\\n\"I feel like I\\'ve heard of that,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not placing it .\"\\n\"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water,\" she explained. \"And with the high purity stuff I\\'ve been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your hip!\"\\nI chuckled. \"And how is it?\" She wasn\\'t going to get any judgment from me .\\nShe handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, \"It\\'s the most instantaneous and intense high I\\'ve ever had,\" she said. \"It makes me so horny that I almost can\\'t control myself .\"\\nKat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her hip high in the air and face in the sheets .\\n\"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger,\" she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking private part, scooped some juice out, and fingered her hipprick. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose .\\n\"Holy that\\'s the best,\" she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. \"Oh my god I need that big shaft in me. Right now .\"\\nShe didn\\'t wait for me to oblige. My shaft stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings .\\n\"I haven\\'t had a shaft this big in so long,\" she panted. \"I\\'ve just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\\'m going to release. I\\'m going to release. No one\\'s made me release like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I\\'m going to need you in my hip .\"\\nI just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn\\'t stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy .\\n\"I want to taste myself,\" she said as she licked and sucked my shaft and balls. \"That was so hot. I thought only toys could make me release like that .\"\\nShe took a firm grip of my shaft and came up to kiss me. \"Now we need to give you a turn, mister,\" she said. \"The only question is, where do you want to put it?\" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. \"You want my hip, don\\'t you?\"\\nI whispered back to her, \"Now it\\'s my turn for a secret. I\\'m an expert at anal. I\\'m a pro at making women release with my shaft in their hip. It\\'s one of my biggest points of pride .\"\\nShe smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, \"Well, I\\'m a bad girl. I\\'m a bad little anal bimbo .\"\\nLogistically, we couldn\\'t just plunge my shaft in her hip. It doesn\\'t work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair .\\nShe grabbed her little spoon again and said, \"Put a couple scoops of this on my hip,\" she said. \"Work it into me with the lube. It\\'ll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want .\"\\nI was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn\\'t about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best experience I\\'d had in years .\\nKat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke .\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"I\\'ll go slow at first .\" As I pressed the head of my shaft against her hipprick, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. \"Take a minute and get used to it,\" I told her .\\n\"I feel so full,\" she said when I bottomed out. \"It\\'s so good, John. Your shaft is perfect .\"\\nShe pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her hip cheeks. Her hip gripped my shaft the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true bimbo .\\n\"I am gonna release so hard,\" she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She\\'d never been so loud. Her hip clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her hip and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed she had usedall the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. \"Holy ,\" she said and grinned. \"Now give me that release. I need that load in my hip. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy .\"\\nI could feel my release wouldn\\'t be long, especially not with Kat\\'s deluge of filthy words urging me on .\\n\"Fill my hip up with your load,\" she begged. \"I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal bimbo .\"\\nI was so close. Looking at how my thick shaft stretched her smooth, lightly pink hipprick was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, \"You\\'re the only one who deserves this hip. My boyfriend shouldn\\'t ever be allowed to have it. Give me that release and show me you want to own this tight little hip .\"\\nThat did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man\\'s woman, and here she was begging for it. My shaft pulsed repeatedly. I don\\'t know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat\\'s enthusiasm surely helped. \"Oh god, I can feel it,\" she moaned. \" flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your hip .\"\\nWe fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. \"We should shower,\" she suggested .\\n\"I may need a bump to keep up with you,\" I said .\\n\"Or you could let me put a little in your hip,\" she said with a smile. \"You\\'ll be ready for another round in no time .\"\\n\"I am definitely open to that,\" I said. \"Maybe later .\"\\nShe laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good , and I knew I\\'d be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I\\'d had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn\\'t even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. .\\nThe coke, steamy shower, and Kat\\'s soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my shaft .\\n\"I have a lot of secrets,\" she said, \"but doing hip-to-mouth is definitely not one .\" I laughed .\\nAs afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of drink and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We have had two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could release again. It was about the intimacy .\\nSomewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, \"Where is this going?\" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep .\\nKat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn\\'t tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I\\'d rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise .\\nWhile we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that\\'s when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn\\'t been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it .\\nIt started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her hip plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more .\\n\"I\\'ve got a new task for you today,\" I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my shaft and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes .\\n\"Yes, sir?\" she said. It wasn\\'t a serious tone of submission. It was always playful .\\n\"I\\'m going to release in your hip,\" I said, matter-of-factly, \"And then plug you. So you\\'ll be plugged with an hip full of my sperm .\"\\nKat\\'s body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. \"That is so naughty,\" she said huskily. \"I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?\"\\n\"I\\'m not done,\" I said. She raised her eyebrows. \"You have to find a way to mention the word \\'plug\\' on the air .\"\\nShe laughed. \"Oh my god,\" she said. \"That is hot. I\\'ll do it .\"\\n\"I\\'ll be watching,\" I said .\\nOur frequency of anal bed time had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the hip this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal .\\nI watched Kat\\'s broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn\\'t stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, \"Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result .\"\\nMaybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. \"How did I do?\" she asked .\\n\"Perfect, baby,\" I said. \"I\\'m working on your reward right now. It\\'s going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!\"\\n\"What is it?\" she inquired .\\n\"That would ruin the surprise. But let\\'s just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu .\"\\n\\nI began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys\\' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick\\'s day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other .\\nFrom the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn\\'t really work. I wasn\\'t the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don\\'t get me wrong. I wasn\\'t bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn\\'t prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun .\\nIf the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started . It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn\\'t mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of movement their hosts .\\nI booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat .\\n\"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16,\" I instructed .\\n\"Weekend getaway?\" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji .\\n\"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?\"\\n\"For four days,\" she said .\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the details next time I see you,\" I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture .\\n\"Come over tomorrow?\" she said .\\n\\nI obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat\\'s customary undressed greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my shaft as she kissed me hello .\\n\"Okay, I have been climbing the walls,\" she said. \"You have got to tell me!\"\\n\"What have you figured out so far?\" I asked.\\n\"St. Patrick\\'s Day weekend,\" she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. \"My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can\\'t go too far .\"\\nI smiled. \"I love how smart you are,\" I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn\\'t. My excitement was too great. \"Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late .\"\\nKat squealed in delight. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you joking?\"\\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"And dinner at Joel Robuchon .\"\\nHer eyes opened wide. \"No way,\" she said. \"At MGM?\"\\nI nodded. She kissed me. \"I\\'m so wet just thinking about it,\" she said .\\n\"I haven\\'t even told you the plans yet!\" I said .\\n\"They can wait,\" she said. \"I need you inside me .\"\\nWe do it raw and hard. I didn\\'t take long to release and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth private part lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat\\'s thighs .\\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked .\\nMy tongue answered for me, as I licked her release-covered cherry .\\n\"You are such a dirty boy,\" she said. \"You filthy guy, you\\'re going to make me release .\"\\nThat wasn\\'t my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her cherry for the few moments she needed to release again. This was filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the release into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction .\\n\"I am a filthy guy,\" I said. \"I warned you about that. I\\'m your filthy guy .\"\\n\"That was hot!\" Kat said. \"I\\'m going to be craving you all day thinking about it .\"\\nAs she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. \"It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That\\'s when he\\'ll be blackout drunk. He won\\'t suspect anything,\" she said .\\n\"I would say I don\\'t care if he does,\" I said, \"but I do care. A lot. I\\'m not going to jeopardize this .\"\\nWe kissed again, then she asked softly, \"Can we get goodies in Vegas?\"\\nI smiled. \"I have an impeccable source .\"\\n\"You have everything figured out,\" she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. \"This trip is going to be really memorable, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"I\\'m pulling out all the stops,\" I said .\\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she asked .\\nI laughed and said, \"Not if you want to ruin the surprise!\"\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79628”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 49, 'cumulative_ads_count': 140, 'days': '07/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-07 14:08:20,2022-09-06 22:09:48', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,shower'}"

She left even before her case was tried .\"\\n\"I know Katerina, she must have left for a reason, Ryegrass .\"\\n\"Who I\\'m I to inject my opinion? She is your mate and the bond between the both of you was very strong .\"\\nWoods moved away from Ryegrass a bit. He wasn\\'t feeling comfortable around him and couldn\\'t figure out why .\\nHis late father had once told him, \"anytime you feel uncomfortable around a werewolf, be very careful .\"\\nHis father may be dead but he connects to him one way or the other through a mind link .\\n\"Go on with your haunting Ryegrass I shall see you tomorrow .\"\\nHis words were final. Ryegrass left immediately transforming and running into the forest .\\n\"He seems harmless, father .\"\\n\"I told you not to trust anyone, I told you .\"\\nThe voice of his father echoed to him through a mind link .\\nHe transformed back into a werewolf and ran into the thickness of the forest .\\n***********************\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\"\\n\"Hahahaha\" the head witch laughed out boastfully .\\n\"I shall take my revenge. Yes, I shall take my revenge on all of them until they\\'re wiped out completely .\"\\n\"But why take revenge on the innocent?\" Aquila asked. She sounded pitiful .\\n\"Be quiet for you know nothing .\" The head witch retorted .\\n\"I know the story. Their forest fathers are the ones guilty .\"\\n\"Oh, my dear Aquila, you are just like your mother naive and stupid .\"\\n\"Do not insult my mother .\"\\n\"How dare you talk back at me?\" The head witch asked her, pointing at her .\"\\n\"For this,\" she continued, \"I shall cast a spell upon you .\"\\nShe moved close to Aquila and touched her with her wand .\\nAquila lost the ability to communicate using the mind link instantly .\\n\"Why did you do that?\" one of the other witches asked .\\n\"I don\\'t trust her, she might expose us .\"\\n\"Is this war really necessary? It\\'s been over decades since the incident happened. The present settlers are only living on instructions passed by their fathers, who also obeyed their fathers .\"\\n\"You lost your mother to them have you forgotten? My mother too and even Aquila\\'s mother. Isn\\'t that enough reason for her not to be nice to these creatures called werewolves?\"\\nShe paused as though she remembered something she had forgotten to say .\\n\"These creatures do not like us, they call us evil. Any attempt to play near their territory will get you killed. Only a few have survived it in the past .\"\\n\"Show her mercy. Undo the spell .\" Another witch suggested .\\n\"Not yet, let her remain that way for a day or two. She has no right to disrespect or talk back at me .\"\\nHaving said that, she disappeared in a puff of smoke .\\nAguila attempted to walk away but one of the witches pulled her back .\\n\"Is there a problem between you two?\"\\n\"No, absolutely not .\"\\n\"Why then has she suddenly turned against you?\"\\n\"This isn\\'t sudden. She is upset with me because I helped her .\"\\n\"But why did you help her? You know we don\\'t go close to those creatures. They don\\'t like us .\"\\n\"You all should stop blaming me. I only did what was right because I am responsible for her predicament .\"\\n\"It is okay, let\\'s go .\" And so the meeting ended with Aquila losing her ability to communicate using the mind link .\\n**********************\\nThe sun was rising in its full glory, and as the heat shimmered in phantom waves, the night things crept back to their holes .\\nThe purple light took a tint of orange. Muted gray and dull brown gave way to the deep crimson and burnt amber .\\nThe colors of the morning mingled and ran along gullies and cracks in the rugged land, sparkling bronze and ruddy in the winding trickle of the beach .\\nAs the light strengthened and the alkali odor of heat drifted up from the desert floor, the girl who slept beneath the tree by the beach bank opened her eyes .\\nHer muscles were stiff, and she lay for a minute or two before looking up at the cloudless sky .\\nShe thought she remembered dreaming something about her mother, the voice bellowing her name over and over again until it sounded as though she was seeing her .\\nBut she wasn\\'t sure, she rarely had good dreams, especially since she had lost one of the gifts she inherited from her mother .\\nShe sat up and drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin between them, and watched the sun explode over the series the water .\\nThe sunrise always reminded her of the beauty of the town, especially that of the beach, and today was no exception .\\nShe raised her head and looked down the beach. Seeing a sign from afar, she stood up and walked in that direction .\\nPeople had started coming out and will soon resume activities for the day. She would have to go somewhere and change so she could look like every other normal person .\\nShe walked down absent-minded, not knowing if she should head straight to her purpose of coming to town or just roam around for a while .\\nPerhaps, maybe she should visit the school premises once again, and have a glimpse of their activities, you know, behave like a student for a few hours .\\nShe chuckled at her very thoughts as they sounded funny to her .\\nThe stares from others were beginning to pierce her skin and she didn\\'t like it. She doubled her steps and walked as fast as her legs could carry her .\\nHer pale gray eyes narrowed behind a screen of smoke. Looking down on Orland\\'s beach like this disturbed her. It made her feel mean to nature .\\nShe finally walked to the road and sat somewhere as though she was waiting for a cab .\\nShe couldn\\'t tell how long she had exactly waited but she was already getting tired when she heard the horn of a car giving her signals to come over .\\nShe cast a glance at the driver who waved at her to come over for a lift. Without much contemplation, she was inside the car already putting on her seat belt .\\n\"Good morning angel,\" He greeted .\\nShe spared him a cold glance and quickly took her eyes off him .\\n\"My name is Cody. What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Aquila,\" she told him without sparing him a glance .\\n\"Beautiful name for a beautiful lady,\" Cody said smiling .\\nAquila wondered why he was smiling for no reason. It looked strange to her. She adjusted her sitting position when she noticed Cody was staring at her lap which was barely covered .\\nIt was only then she realized her clothes barely covered her entire body. She became uncomfortable .\\n\"Hey, so where are you headed to?\" Cody asked breaking the long silence between them .\\nAquila looked at him, opened her mouth but couldn\\'t even find her words. She had no idea where she was headed at that moment but she sure knew she needed a change of cloth and food .\\n\"I, I,\" she stuttered .\\nCody took another look at her and spoke again .\\n\"You look so rough and dirty. Would like me to take you home?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she said nodding her head. \"Oh, no, no, no .\" She had no home to go to she remembered .\\n\"I can\\'t go home like this,\" Aquila told him .\\n\"Okay, I get it. Do you mind if I take you home so you could have a bath and change of clothes?\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t .\"\\nAs they drove, Aquila concentrated on the streets facing the window .\\nTo the north lay back, razor-straight line of Highway 57, which came out of Taxes. She saw and sign post with the inscription Republica Road, as they took another route .\\nNo cars moved on Highway 57 but a few vultures were circling something dead .\\nHer gaze shifted to the south, across the river toward the small houses and buildings of the town .\\nOver there, the four narrow dusty streets had no names, just numbers, and all of them but Fourth Street were dead ends, as their signpost stated .\\nAnd then she saw a magnificent building, it was one of the oldest in the town, a Catholic church, Cody had explained to her when he noticed the way she was staring at it .\\nAquila could see the flare of welding torches through the windows of a workshop, and a lug-nut weapon squealed .\\nThree tractor-trailer trucks were parked in there, awaiting cargo .\\nCody turned towards the west. His gaze followed the dark line of Cobre Road. Three miles away was the huge red crater of the Orlando Mining Company .\\nAround the crater stood office buildings, storage sheds, and many others that got her wonder .\\nShe looked again at the quiet town, population about nineteen hundred and slipping fast. She could imagine she heard the clocks ticking in the houses .\\nSunlight was creeping around curtains and through blinds to streak the walls with fire. Soon, these alarms would go off shocking the sleepers into another day .\\nThose with jobs would get dressed and leave their houses, running before the electric prod of time, to their various jobs .\\nAnd at the end of the day, they would all return to their houses, do what they had to do until those clocks whispered sleep again .\\nBut she, what would she do, where would she go to? That\\'s certainly not a question for the day .\\nLayla Richmond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table .\\nAs if it would go off any time soon, she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand .\\nShe sniffed the air, she could smell the inviting aromas of freshly brewed coffee .\\n\"Breakfast\\'s on, Layla!\" Richmond called from the kitchen .\\n\"Three more minutes .\" She burrowed her head into the pillow .\\n\"Big minutes or little ones?\"\\n\"Tiny ones, baby .\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow .\\n\"You smell like a puppy,\" Layla said sleepily .\\n\"Pardon?\"\\n\"What?\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again .\\n\"How about some lizard eggs in your egg today?\" Richmond asked .\\nHe and Layla had stayed up until well after one in the morning talking about their friend and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun .\\nRichmond had always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Layla took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on her best days. One of the reasons she loved Richmond .\\n\"Make mine rare,\" she answered teasingly and tried seeing again .\\nThe early light was already glory, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and Orlando Channel had said today might break the hundred mark .\\nLayla knew that meant trouble. The bushes will be hot and animals don\\'t acclimate to such heat .\\nHorses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness .\\nStock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. Her worst fears were stories about full moons and Grange Forest .\\nAll the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\\'t bring their pets in for treatment .\\nIt might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pick-up truck today and drive around to some small communities near Orlando to spread the antirabies gospel.\\n\"Morning.\" Richmond was standing over her, offering her coffee in a white clay mug. \"This will get you started,\" he continued .\\nShe sat up and took the mug. The coffee as usual whenever Richmond made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system .\\nShe needed it too. She had never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian expert within the town and a thirty-mile radius, she had learned for long that farmers and ranchers in smaller communities were always up before the first sun blushed the sky .\\n\"Smooth,\" Layla managed to say .\\n\"Always is .\" Richmond smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. The red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his glasses .\\nHe looked east, along Calic Street towards Repulica Road and Dawn High School .\\n\"The Hotbox,\" he called it because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade .\\nLayla knew what he was thinking . They had talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal .\\n\"Come her,\" she said and motioned him to bed .\\n\"Beacon will get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Orlando whereas Layla\\'s was different .\\n\"Let it freeze .\"\\nRichmond turned away from the window and could feel the hot stripes of the sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and uncomfortable khaki trousers, but his socks were still on .\\nHe passed under the bedroom\\'s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Layla leaned over in her pale red oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed .\\nWhen he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her hands .\\n\\n\"Your muscles are as tight as a piano wire,\" she teased .\\nRichmond smiled without uttering a word .\\n\"It\\'s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\\'t the end of the world .\"\\nHe nodded and said nothing. The nod wasn\\'t very convincing .\\nRichmond Bill was thirty-five years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim, and in a pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging .\\nHis light brown hair was receding to show what Layla called a \"noble forehead\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent teacher, he was .\\nRichmond has been teaching history at Dawn High School for 7 years and now with the recent happening around, he was beginning to face his worst fears .\\nIt was still there, just as it has been there for many years. And every day for the past seven years, he had seen it working against him .\\n\"You\\'ve done everything you could,\" Layla said. \"You know you have.\"\\n\"Maybe. Maybe not .\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration .\\nA week from tomorrow, when the school closed and the others would have no job, his resumes brought him only field job but that wouldn\\'t take his mind off his predicament .\\nRunning exams for charity organizations was also one thing he looks forward to as each school section was coming to an end .\\nIt gives him ample time to focus on the children and give back to his community. Perhaps that would help him forget what had happened in the past and probably make him forgive himself; his guess .\\nAnother job offer he looked forward to, to take his mind off what bothers him was running exams for migrant workers. It wouldn\\'t be so bad though it required a lot of time on the road .\\nWhat had chewed at him over the years day and night was the memory of school children. Hundreds of them had passed through his class. An average who had wanted to learn more about the history of werewolves and had probably ventured going camping at Grange .\\nThose who returned were obviously never the same and it definitely hurts. It hurts him badly. He was a good teacher, his only regret was teaching them history about the dark lords, Grange, and werewolves .\\nLayla kept massaging, but Richmond\\'s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder .\\nRichmond stared at the bars of the fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three .\"\\n\\nHe had a sudden startling image of the day he and Layla had graduated from the University, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world .\\nIt seemed like a hundred years ago. They were in Taxes then. He had been thinking a lot about him lately, Dr. Lyons Washington. And he knew why.\\n\"Dr. Lyons Washington,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about him?\"\\n\"I think so .\"\\nLayla does remember vividly the great Dr Lyons Washington but she hates to talk about him .\\n\"He was the best in the department then,\" Richmond added .\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to tell me .\" Layla\\'s reply was short and abrupt .\\n\"I know you hated him,\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about .\"\\n\"Come off it, Layla, you do .\" Richmond tried to hide the disgust in his voice .\\n\"I\\'m not the only one who hated him. Everyone did, except,\"\\n\"A few students like us who perhaps wanted to learn more about dark secrets .\"\\n\"You can say that again .\"\\n\"Don\\'t sound that way, Layla .\"\\n\"How do you want me to sound, Richmond? That man is part of the reason you\\'re in pain and keep walking around with guilt .\"\\n\\n\"He is not. He never forced any of us into learning what we had learned from him .\"\\n\"And if I hadn\\'t stopped you?\" She did not need him to answer the question. \"You would probably be a vampire by now or even a werewolf, depending on that which he was willing to bless you with .\"\\nHis bitter smile was back again. He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete .\\n\"There are two boys in my last period class who reminds me of Lyons. Neither one of them ever made higher than a B-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces .\"\\n\"What do you see?\" Layla\\'s question sounded witty .\\n\"I see that they listen; something sinks. You probably know their names .\" He glanced at her .\\nLayla had heard Richmond mention the names before, and she nodded .\\n\"Neither of them took the college exams,\" Richmond continued. \"They both laughed at me when I suggested it .\"\\n\"You should probably leave them. Let them make their choices .\" Layla sounded nonchalant this time .\\n\"But their last day is tomorrow, and they will graduate a week from Sunday, and that will be it .\"\\n\"You have done what you could,\" she said. \"Now it\\'s up to them.\"\\n\"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace .\\n\"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\\'m beginning to believe there\\'s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher .\"\\n\"She tried to smile but couldn\\'t. \" You take care of your beast and I will take care of mine.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He summoned up a weak smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Layla\\'s head, his gingers disappearing into her dark short cut hair, and kissed her forehead .\\n\"I love you, doc .\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me .\"\\n\"I love you,\" she answered and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Layla said, \"Lizard eyeballs?\"\\n\"Yep .\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Layla knew that however a good teacher a was, Richmond thought of himself as a failure .\\n\"I guess they are good and cold by now. Come and get them .\"\\nLayla got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Richmond had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows .\\nThe light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning blue .\\nRichmond had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates, each with bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast, and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner .\\n\"No lizard eggs today, let\\'s go, sleepy heads,\" Richmond called towards the kid\\'s room and Sybill answered with an unenthusiastic grunt .\\nLayla went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Richmond switched on the radio to catch the 7a .m news from the New Orlando station\\nSybill bounded into the kitchen. \"It\\'s horse day, boy,\" she said. \"We get to go see sweetpea!\"\\nIt amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a four-year-old kid .\\nLayla poured a glass of orange juice for her while the little boy clad in one of her old T-shirts from school, and climbed into his chair .\\nHe sat perched on the edge, swinging his legs and chewing at a piece of toast .\\n\"How did you sleep?\" Layla asked her son.\\n\"Good. Can I ride sweetpea today?\"\\n\"Maybe. We\\'ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say .\"\\n\\nLayla was scheduled to drive out to Lucas\\'s place to give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough check-up this morning .\\nSweetpea was a gentle horse that Mr. Lucas and his wife had raised from a colt, and Layla knew how much her son looked forward to their trip .\\n\"Don\\'t give me that look, Richmond. It is just a horse, not some wild beast Lyons taught you .\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79732”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 91, 'cumulative_ads_count': 91, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:10:04', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:10:19', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:10:36', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

I opened it and saw him looking at the two laptops on the table that was on the side. The laptop was wired to the CCTVs .\\n\"You\\'re calling me?\" why am I stuttering? He took a deep breath and stared at me. He looked at the tray I was carrying. I cleared my throat and approached his desk and landed in the vacant space there .\\nI couldn\\'t look at him so I looked around his room .\\nSofa set in front of flatscreen tv. There is a table here with a swivel chair. A king-size bed covered by a black cushion. also, black colored carpet lying on the floor. In one word. ‘Manly’ is really his room .\\nI was just standing there by his side. He leaned back in his swivel chair and he applied his back to its backrest. He looked tired but so handsome. I mean, no words can explain his appearance. There is nothing wrong with our race .\\n\"Why you are late? I cook your favorite .” He asked that I was simply tired of looking. I want to be embarrassed .\\n\"We have a practice for the prom ..\" I explained. Maybe papa will keep an eye on me. He nodded and played a game of his hand lip. I looked at his lips for a moment and immediately avoided...He smirked and licked his lips ... am I obvious?\\nHe stood up so I looked up because of his stature. He took a step towards me .\\n\"Four more nights you were late coming home .\" every step he takes forward he is my back. Gosh..what is he doing?\\nI blinked as I couldn\\'t look at him directly. Then three more thrusts..he was my back. I immediately felt the cold wall. Dead end .\\n\"Who drives you here?\" he asked seriously but I don\\'t think I heard. The noise of my heart rate overcame me more. I was just stunned when he bowed slightly so we could line up. He put his both hands on either side of my head...\\nI cursed a million in my mind. I am nervous. The speed of my heartbeat. I took a deep breath. I forgot our distance just a few feet away. The heat of her body seemed to attract me.\\n\"Distance, please! I can\\'t breathe,” I said coldly to him and pushed him slightly but he was harder he didn\\'t move .\\n\"Shall I repeat my question Roxette?\" I could hear the anger in his voice there .\\nI gritted my teeth with so much emotion. \"Why? Why are you asking? Because dad asked you? me that you should watch? Your sweet uncle then. \"\\nHis jaw clenched. The vein came out of his arm because his fist was already clenched on my side. I was nervous because of that .\\nHe leaned closer. His nose was so close to mine. Just a little movement will apply to our lips. Does he know what he is doing?\\n\"I\\'m watching you the way I want. I don\\'t need anyone else\\'s notice. Now, answer me. Who is that? Boyfriend?\"\\nI stared at him. \"he\\'s Simon. A friend, not a boyfriend. \"I focused my gaze on his lips. It was nice to pull the nape and kiss him. oh! It\\'s justice to me! Why is this handsome creature, my uncle? He suddenly bit his lips so I turned around and looked into his eyes .\\nHis hand touches my lips ..\"Who\\'s your first kiss?\" He asked huskily in a cold voice .\\nI swallowed and shook. \"Nothing yet ..\"\\nBut I remember the one on the veranda. His lips slightly touched my lips then. But just a little! I don\\'t know if it was the first kiss?\\nHe nodded briefly. \"What if ....\" he tucked some strand of my hair in my ear .\\n\"I kiss you right now? What will you do?\" He whispered that only the two of us could hear .\\nI was shocked as if my whole being shaken at what he said. What! I bit my trembling lips and looked at his lips again. hmm..inviting .. what does it taste like? So soft?\\nHis kiss on my cheek made me close and he slowly moved his lips closer to mine. My leg shook as his lips lightly touched mine. He pressed my waist. But my lips were not completely covered when there was a knock on the door .\\nI took a deep breath and pushed him. He seemed to have poured cold water on my body. Oh my god ...\\nI covered my lips as he looked up and covered his forehead as if angry .\\n\"Who\\'s that ?!\" he shouted .\\n\"Ah, Sir! ! Here\\'s what you\\'re asking for from the boutique ...\" said the maid outside the door .\\nSav walked there while I was looking for a captain because I thought I would collapse. I raised my hand on the table and rewind in my mind what happened. I heard the door close so I looked up. He has two boxes that are large and one that is small .\\nhe handed it to me. \"For you...\"\\nI blinked and took it. \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"Open it ..\"! his husky voice .. insane voice... He\\'s really my ideal man. I laid it on the table and took off the ribbon that was rolled up in the big box .\\nI gasped in surprise. It\\'s a cocktail dress!\\n\"Oh my god..it\\'s beautiful!\" I gasped in awe. How did he know that the cocktail dress was the motif at our prom? Gosh .\\nHe nodded. It was gray with glitters. That tube type but no cleavage. It\\'s just straight, not V neck. Seems like I don’t want to show my chest? It\\'s really super nice. It fits me even if I just look. I also took off the roll of a box and found those silver stilettos! nice!\\nI smiled and looked at him. \"Thank you, really!\" He bit his lip as he looked at me. A hint of amusement plastered on his face .\\n\"All for you..baby ..\"\\nChapter 6\\nIt was a big mistake. The attraction I feel for Sav. Many handsome flirts with me, but why with my uncle? What kind of heart do I have? Tsk. I buried it all in oblivion, I also don\\'t know why he moves the same way towards me? He even asked me what if he will be my first kiss?\\nWhen that incident ended two days ago. Everything became normal. Sometimes we share breakfast. He was just cold. He always has a cellphone call that he calls babe. He also comes home at night once, he is drunk. That hurts my heart, I think my heart is abnormal .\\nOf course, it\\'s wrong to like him, my uncle. That was the most painful part of me. just really unfair. But, I will try my best. So, hard to keep this feeling. I know I can find a man for me too, but I\\'m not ready yet, fling will do .\\nWe are in the MOA now. I went with my driver because I don\\'t know how to drive yet and because it\\'s still forbidden for someone like me who is seventeen years old. I really don\\'t want to go with the driver once in a while because Jezel went to see us a lot .\\nWe came from practicing folk dance at school and we went straight here because we have something to buy for tomorrow. It\\'s the last day of our practice today and our prom is coming...\\n\"Did you tell Gerald that his necktie should be gray?\" Jezel asked me. Gerald was my partner at the prom. He’s a nerd. I prefer him to the others who are too smooth. Gerald isn\\'t ugly, he\\'s really just a need to look at because of his big glasses. Gray and black is the motif of our prom. So my cocktail gown is gray so Gerald and I should have a suit .\\n\"Yep!\" I answer and look at the VS perfumes lined up. One of the perfumes in my collection. I took the night\\'s seduction and smelled it. The scent was really nice!\\n\"Will you be picked up?\"\\nI shook. \"Uncle Savier will drive me .\" note the sarcasm in uncle\\'s word. He said he would take me. He was also invited because he is one of the sponsors of St. Dominic.\\n\"Wow. The sweet one .\"\\nI stared at him. \"Shut up .\" I also choose dark red lipsticks. because my other lipstick is pink, so it\\'s different. Jezel is just next to me and asking .\\n\"Maybe they\\'re Miss Ocampo?\" I stopped at his question. Yeah, those past days. He always goes to school and picks up Miss Ocampo. Our New English school teacher. she\\'s pretty, matured, and an ideal girl. That’s why I spend time practicing to avoid being non -judgmental .\\nI have no right to get mad. Whoever he wants, I can do nothing but support him. That\\'s my role being his niece .\\n\"Who cares? They\\'re something .\" I said bitterly and took the purchases and went straight to the counter while Jez was just tailing .\\n\"E \\'why do you seem sad? Tss! I told you Rox, move on. That feeling will kill you!\" She whispered to me as I paid. After being paid I walked out. I did not answer Jez. My chest tightens. That\\'s why I\\'m avoiding it .\\n\"Rox! Sorry! Are you mad?\" Jez chased me .\\nI smiled bitterly as we exited. \"I\\'m trying Jez. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let my uncle hurt me .\" She took a deep breath and put her arm around me.\\n“Just. I’m only here when you\\'re sad. Hmm? \"\\nI rolled my eyes. \"You\\'re a drama!\"\\n\"Chee, I don\\'t know about you .\" We laughed as we got into the car. I just finished dinner and entered the room. Since I was excited about the prom I prepared everything I would need. the cocktail gown I hung on the hanger and placed in the closet. The stilleto. The makeup is all set. The earring, bracelet, and contact lens, etc. I was stunned to hear Sav’s car just arrived. It\\'s nine o\\'clock and he\\'ll just arrive?\\nI took a deep breath and thought he might not have eaten yet. So I went down because I knew the two helpers were asleep. Going down the stairs, the door suddenly opened and Sav entered, apparently drunk but still smiling. My attention was divided when I saw a woman leading him. or I must say, It’s miss Ocampo .\\nIt turned white dress with flowers. The body is curved and high heels are still on .\\n\"Where\\'s your room babe?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Where\\'s your room2x?”Tsk. Sav\\'s smile on Miss Ocampo\\'s body was so close that it gave my heart pain. Before they could go up. I sneezed .\\nThey both stopped and I saw Sav look at me seriously. no more naughtiness. Well... I\\'m just assuming too much. Why would the uncle be sweet to his niece? And when else was it legal for the uncle to kiss his niece? It\\'s a sin!\\n\"Why are you here Miss Ocampo?\" I asked formally .\\nShe suddenly formalized. \"Hmm...Sav was drunk so I supported him .\" I nodded so that Sav could almost fall asleep on her shoulder .\\n\"Any help? Because he\\'s heavy .\" She added. I had no choice but to help them. Why is he so drunk?\\n\"-Why is he drunk miss?\" I asked as Sav landed on the bed. He groaned as his back pressed against the bed. He’s just wearing a gray T-shirt and pants .\\nMiss Ocampo shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. He drank l the spirits would be like water. Hmm..by the way, does he live here?\" She asked .\\nI nodded. \"I\\'ll just get some lukewarm water .\"\\nI quickly went to the kitchen and got lukewarm water and filled it with liquor. I also took a wipe. I was annoyed because another woman entered his room. stop it Rox. He\\'s your uncle! He already has a girlfriend!\\nMy chest tightened as I went back upstairs to his bedroom. I opened the door and shuddered at where I stood. My innocent eyes! Miss Ocampo is already on Sav\\'s lap. We\\'re kissing torridly. Miss Ocampo\\'s tube dress had fallen off and Sav was already taking off his t-shirt. He held Miss Ocampo\\'s waist and caressed her butt! They were groaning and moaning...\\nI was cold and shivering as the bowl of lukewarm water I was holding collapsed. They immediately separated and stopped. Miss Ocampo immediately left Sav’s lap .\\nI didn\\'t look at them and just bowed. \"I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t know I\\'m sorry!\" I close my eyes and immediately turn around before they can see my tears. I immediately ran to my room and locked it. I ran to sit on the floor on the side of the bed and leaned back on the bed .\\nI was caught in my chest tightening and I could barely breathe. My sobs echoed in the four corners of my room. I wiped away my tears .\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be hurt!\" I built a cup on my chest. “I hate this F-feeling ! I hate my h-heart! \"\\nI was stopped by a knock on the door from outside. \"Rox! Open the door!\" Sav\\'s hoarse cry. Only in its voice will you know that it has been drunk .\\nI remained silent and sobbed. I was speechless. I\\'ve seen him bring a woman here a few times but it hurts more to see what they\\'re doing .\\nI stopped and was even more nervous when the door suddenly opened. What? I locked it! Sav came in, still topless and holding a key. That\\'s why. I averted my eyes when I saw his anticipating look. His eyes were bulging and he was obviously drunk. I can’t look at his handsome body and has eight abs. Darn. He took a deep breath and I could see his footsteps approaching .\\nI closed my eyes firmly with my heart pounding. the crash that I only feel when he\\'s there. His effect on my heart was really strange. This is so bad. He bowed in front of me. One knee was kneeling on the floor and the other was raised and placed his arm there .\\n\"Let\\'s talk,\" he said hoarsely. I immediately inhaled the smell of his breath mixed with mint and liquor. I opened my eyes and my tears flowed. His palm rose and wiped away my tears which I immediately avoided .\\n\"Don\\'t touch me. Just talk .\" I said coldly .\\nHe heaved and sighed. \"Okay ..\" he raised his hand to my side. I hugged my knee .\\n\"Why did you follow? What about your girlfriend?\" I asked. It was hoarse from crying and trembling .\\n\"Who won\\'t follow if you\\'re crying?\" He insisted. His jaw clamped dangerously. He seemed to have lost his drunkenness .\\n“You care ?!” I Spat. \"Don\\'t pretend, please. I\\'m fine. Go away .\" New tears flowed. I bit my trembling lips .\\n\"Why are you crying?\" Instead, he asked. Why? Should I tell the truth? It was as if I had just put myself in harm\\'s way .\\n\"Go aways! you dirty man! Go away! \"I shouted and slapped him on the face and chest. I didn\\'t care if his handsome face got hurt. He didn\\'t stop me, he just let me go. Until I got tired of the beating. His face was red. and I did not even bear my blow to him. He\\'s massive and strong. So maybe that\\'s just not in him .\\n\"You\\'re done?\" He parted the strand of hair on my face. I shunned .\\n\"I hate you!\"\\nHe nodded .\\n\"Why are you crying? May I know why?\" He asked softly .\\n\"Because I hate you,\" I answered immediately. He grabbed my chin and faced him. His dark and expressive eyes were really beautiful. The thick eyebrows and sharp nose. His naturally red lips. He\\'s perfect .\\n\"Hating your uncle is normal. Do you know what\\'s wrong? the wrong is if you love more than a normal love. Not as an uncle, but as a man. ” I stiffened in my seat .\\nThose past years there was no such partnership with us. He always makes business trips abroad. And busy at work. I bit my lip and bowed. My chest is pounding. What does he mean? Am I too obvious?\\n“Did you know I’m ready to fight the whole world for someone? Do you know I’m just waiting for the chance to let her know how I feel? I will fight for us. Even if this family breaks up. \" He said seriously. He looked straight into my eyes .\\n\"W-What are you saying?\" I whispered .\\nHe leaned closer and kissed my forehead and my nose ... then he stops. \"If I will ask you, to run away with me... Would you?\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79577\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:10:52', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report .\\nA couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my shaft stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my release, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing release-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my shaft. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my shaft, begging me to fill her. Was her hip still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn\\'t long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind\\'s focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn\\'t even have her phone number .\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn\\'t have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn\\'t out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she\\'d reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted .\\nHer proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat\\'s drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself.\\nThe wait for Kat\\'s message wasn\\'t long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here .\\n\"John -- I can\\'t believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me .\\n\"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don\\'t need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love risk. Feeling your release inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I\\'ve had in years. You can\\'t imagine how excited I was, having your release in my panties. My private part was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven\\'t indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the bimboty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges .\\n\"This won\\'t all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You\\'d be surprised at all the things we\\'ll be able to do. Did you know I wear a hip plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn\\'t have them until now. And now I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to stop .\\n\"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I\\'ve always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat\"\\nTo me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn\\'t come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat\\'s apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely undressed. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her private part and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled .\\n\"You taste so sweet,\" I said .\\nShe smiled and said, \"I get so wet thinking about your shaft. I need it in me .\" She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking private part on irresistible display. \"Don\\'t be gentle,\" she said. \"And I haven\\'t done my hair yet .\"\\nI simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of hip cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, \"Harder .\" I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a chest and tweaking her papilla firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her cherry briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my shaft never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her private part. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone .\\n\"Yes! yes!\" she moaned .\\nI released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute doll. Her magic private part never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my shaft .\\n\"I own you,\" I growled. \"This is my cherry, you bimbo .\"\\n\"Yes! Yes, sir!\" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her climax building. I moved her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her private part spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her private part, flowing down my shaft and her thighs .\\nIt was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. \"Jesus, Kat, you\\'re going to make me release,\" I shouted .\\n\" that\\'s so hot,\" she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. \"Just fill me .\"\\nI closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. \"Oh, god, here it comes,\" I said. It was as if I couldn\\'t control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, \"Yes, baby!\" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my shaft in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix .\\nWe were panting. I grabbed a handful of hip again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me .\\n\"I\\'m on fire,\" she said. \"You really do own me .\"\\nI kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her private part. \"Squeeze it out,\" I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine .\"\\n\"You\\'re like a Kitty Kat when you\\'re being a bimbo like this,\" I said. \"The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night .\"\\nShe gave a soft moan and showed me the release before she swallowed. \"I like that,\" she said and paused. \"You have no idea how bad I\\'ve needed this .\" She moved to kiss me, then pulled back .\\n\"I don\\'t mind,\" I said. \"Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy people I am .\"\\nWe embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too .\\n\"That was so hot,\" Kat said .\\n\"I like to be in control,\" I told her .\\n\"I need to be controlled,\" she said. \"Within reason .\"\\nI laughed and changed the subject. \"I have no idea how you\\'re going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap .\"\\nShe smiled her TV smile and said, \"Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think .\"\\nI raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at .\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bedroom. \"I\\'ll let you in on a really big secret,\" she said. \"No judgment, okay?\"\\nI nodded. \"I\\'m not in a position to judge .\"\\nShe directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above undressed heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, \"Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away .\" My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual .\\nKat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, \"It\\'s all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?\"\\nI smiled, broadly and genuinely. \"I have always loved a party girl,\" I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss .\\nI sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of release out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a pro .\\nI replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. it was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat\\'s habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke bimbo had a gravitational pull .\\nWhile Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. \"Is this the day of the week that you have your hip plug in? Or were two loads of release enough?\" I said .\\nI finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. \"There is never enough release,\" Kat replied .\\n\"That didn\\'t answer my question,\" I responded .\\n\"No,\" she answered immediately, \"it\\'s not plug day .\"\\n\"Prove it,\" I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled .\\nIt was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop .\\nAs I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again .\\n\"Satisfied?\" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her hip, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot .\\n\"Good girl,\" I wrote back. \"But not satisfied .\"\\nI silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.\\nKat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, \"But not satisfied .\" It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:\\n\"Daddy, please, I need it .\" It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her hip cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess hip plug snugly in her hip .\\nAfter that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Undressed greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent . Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn\\'t become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside .\\nTo be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn\\'t have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling .\\nI had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I\\'d make her coffee. She\\'d snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she\\'d been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I\\'d leave her apartment ten minutes before she did .\\nOne morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day\\'s floral-patterned dress, I said, \"Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it .\"\\nShe blinked. \"Okay .\"\\n\"Okay?\" I asked .\\n\"Okay,\" she repeated. \"All you had to do was ask .\" Her smile was wry .\\nI was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur .\\n\"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?\" I offered .\\nShe shook her head. \"I\\'m going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis .\"\\nIf Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. \"I\\'ll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend\\'s out of town, right?\"\\nShe smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn\\'t have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in .\\nThe suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat\\'s lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn\\'t sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn\\'t willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels .\\nThen the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again .\\n\"I couldn\\'t eat, I was so excited,\" she said. I realized eating hadn\\'t even occurred to me. She walked to the suite\\'s dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, \"Unzip me .\" I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off .\\n\"Leave the heels on,\" I said. I pulled her to me again, hip first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully .\\n\"You don\\'t have anything to do the rest of the day, right?\" she said .\\n\"I\\'m yours .\"\\nOne side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I\\'d learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. \"I want to party,\" she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. \"And let you use me. I want your release in all three holes. Think you can handle it?\"\\nI chuckled. \"I\\'m always up for a challenge .\"\\n\"Good,\" she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. \"You want some?\"\\n\" yeah,\" I said. \"It\\'s been a while. And don\\'t worry. I don\\'t get coke shaft .\"\\n\"Oh really,\" she said, never taking her eyes off her task. \"I\\'m going to test you on that. I\\'m also going to show you a little secret of mine .\"\\n\"We\\'re getting past the tip of the iceberg?\" I asked .\\n\"Definitely, and we are going deep,\" she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes .\\n\"Ladies first,\" I said .\\nKat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. \"This is so pure,\" she said. \"An old coworker can get the best blow. You\\'d like her .\"\\nI smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed .\\nShe leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun .\\nI took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good . Kat\\'s eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. \"I love on coke,\" she said. \"You better watch out .\"\\n\"You weren\\'t lying,\" I said between kisses. \"This is good .\"\\nShe undressed me and said, \"One day I might introduce you. That\\'s pretty deep into the iceberg .\"\\nWe were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. \"I\\'ve been wanting to taste you so badly,\" I said .\\nIn the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her papilla to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her private part lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips .\\n\"You want to know one of my secrets?\" I said. \"This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty private part for an hour. I have eaten a pretty private part for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you .\"\\nI dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her cherry. I flicked her cherry twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her private part, diving in as deep as I could every few moments .\\n\"I love that soft tongue,\" Kat breathed .\\nI continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her private part had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her cherry now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her private part. All I cared about was making her release. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her private part became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. \"What... what are you doing to me?\" she panted .\\nShe pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed .\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever release like that,\" she said, her eyes not leaving mine .\\n\"It\\'s just the tip of the iceberg,\" I teased .\\nI cupped her chest. They were perfect small handfuls with hard papillas. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her hip. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her private part\\'s wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her papilla into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her hipprick. She didn\\'t clench her cheeks at all .\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"Give me a minute .\"\\nKat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. \"I want a line off your shaft,\" she said. \"Body blows are so much fun .\"\\nI moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. \"No, stand up,\" she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and arised by shaft to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn\\'t seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief .\\n\"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke bimbo?\" she said softly .\\nI didn\\'t have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my shaft, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my shaft in one gulp. Kat sucked shaft like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She aris ed my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down .\\n\"please,\" she begged .\\nI put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my shaft in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I\\'d hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed .\\nThis continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my shaft, with a loud slurp .\\n\"You should feel how wet you\\'ve made me,\" she said .\\nShe stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were .\\n\"You are such a shaftsucking bimbo,\" I said .\\n\"I am. I love sucking shaft so much,\" she said. \"Lie down .\"\\nShe renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I\\'d rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn\\'t long before I knew I was about to release. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting shaft. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent .\\n\"Jesus,\" I sighed .\\nKat\\'s coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my release in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed .\\n\"I love release almost as much as sucking shaft,\" she said. \"You have no idea .\"\\nMy shaft was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine .\\n\"You are checking some serious boxes for me,\" I said. \"You have no idea. A coke bimbo. A releasebimbo. What\\'s next?\" I honestly couldn\\'t believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks .\\n\"How about some Champagne?\" I suggested. \"I\\'ll order room service, too. I don\\'t want to pass the point of being able to function .\"\\nShe nestled her head into the crook of my neck. \"That sounds perfect,\" she said. \"I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach .\"\\n\"Oh, that wasn\\'t a big enough load for you?\" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne .\\n\"There is never enough release,\" she said seductively. She was in a hyper- zone .\\nThe Champagne opened with that most pleasing \"Pop!\" I picked up the phone to call room service. \"Nachos?\" I asked Kat, who still languished undressed on the bed. Her papilla poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound .\\n\"Yes!\" she said. \"I love junk food when I\\'m partying .\"\\nI ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed .\\n\"The food will be here in about twenty minutes,\" I said .\\n\"Just enough recovery time,\" she said .\\nI brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service .\\n\"How\\'d you get into the party scene?\" I asked .\\n\"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station,\" she said. \"My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn\\'t the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don\\'t have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like .\"\\nI told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls\\' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch .\\nRoom service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate undressed. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures .\\nEventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. \"I\\'m going to show you a secret,\" she said .\\nI followed her swaying hip into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed .\\n\"So Kelly taught me this,\" she said, referring to her LA television friend. \"If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to hip bump it .\" She giggled .\\n\"I feel like I\\'ve heard of that,\" I said, \"but I\\'m not placing it .\"\\n\"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water,\" she explained. \"And with the high purity stuff I\\'ve been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your hip!\"\\nI chuckled. \"And how is it?\" She wasn\\'t going to get any judgment from me .\\nShe handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, \"It\\'s the most instantaneous and intense high I\\'ve ever had,\" she said. \"It makes me so horny that I almost can\\'t control myself .\"\\nKat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her hip high in the air and face in the sheets .\\n\"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger,\" she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking private part, scooped some juice out, and fingered her hipprick. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose .\\n\"Holy that\\'s the best,\" she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. \"Oh my god I need that big shaft in me. Right now .\"\\nShe didn\\'t wait for me to oblige. My shaft stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings .\\n\"I haven\\'t had a shaft this big in so long,\" she panted. \"I\\'ve just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I\\'m going to release. I\\'m going to release. No one\\'s made me release like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I\\'m going to need you in my hip .\"\\nI just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn\\'t stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy .\\n\"I want to taste myself,\" she said as she licked and sucked my shaft and balls. \"That was so hot. I thought only toys could make me release like that .\"\\nShe took a firm grip of my shaft and came up to kiss me. \"Now we need to give you a turn, mister,\" she said. \"The only question is, where do you want to put it?\" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. \"You want my hip, don\\'t you?\"\\nI whispered back to her, \"Now it\\'s my turn for a secret. I\\'m an expert at anal. I\\'m a pro at making women release with my shaft in their hip. It\\'s one of my biggest points of pride .\"\\nShe smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, \"Well, I\\'m a bad girl. I\\'m a bad little anal bimbo .\"\\nLogistically, we couldn\\'t just plunge my shaft in her hip. It doesn\\'t work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair .\\nShe grabbed her little spoon again and said, \"Put a couple scoops of this on my hip,\" she said. \"Work it into me with the lube. It\\'ll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want .\"\\nI was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn\\'t about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best experience I\\'d had in years .\\nKat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke .\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" I said, \"I\\'ll go slow at first .\" As I pressed the head of my shaft against her hipprick, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. \"Take a minute and get used to it,\" I told her .\\n\"I feel so full,\" she said when I bottomed out. \"It\\'s so good, John. Your shaft is perfect .\"\\nShe pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her hip cheeks. Her hip gripped my shaft the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true bimbo .\\n\"I am gonna release so hard,\" she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She\\'d never been so loud. Her hip clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her hip and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed she had usedall the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. \"Holy ,\" she said and grinned. \"Now give me that release. I need that load in my hip. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy .\"\\nI could feel my release wouldn\\'t be long, especially not with Kat\\'s deluge of filthy words urging me on .\\n\"Fill my hip up with your load,\" she begged. \"I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal bimbo .\"\\nI was so close. Looking at how my thick shaft stretched her smooth, lightly pink hipprick was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, \"You\\'re the only one who deserves this hip. My boyfriend shouldn\\'t ever be allowed to have it. Give me that release and show me you want to own this tight little hip .\"\\nThat did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man\\'s woman, and here she was begging for it. My shaft pulsed repeatedly. I don\\'t know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat\\'s enthusiasm surely helped. \"Oh god, I can feel it,\" she moaned. \" flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your hip .\"\\nWe fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. \"We should shower,\" she suggested .\\n\"I may need a bump to keep up with you,\" I said .\\n\"Or you could let me put a little in your hip,\" she said with a smile. \"You\\'ll be ready for another round in no time .\"\\n\"I am definitely open to that,\" I said. \"Maybe later .\"\\nShe laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good , and I knew I\\'d be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I\\'d had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn\\'t even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. .\\nThe coke, steamy shower, and Kat\\'s soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my shaft .\\n\"I have a lot of secrets,\" she said, \"but doing hip-to-mouth is definitely not one .\" I laughed .\\nAs afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of drink and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We have had two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could release again. It was about the intimacy .\\nSomewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, \"Where is this going?\" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep .\\nKat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn\\'t tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I\\'d rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise .\\nWhile we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that\\'s when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn\\'t been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it .\\nIt started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her hip plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more .\\n\"I\\'ve got a new task for you today,\" I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my shaft and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes .\\n\"Yes, sir?\" she said. It wasn\\'t a serious tone of submission. It was always playful .\\n\"I\\'m going to release in your hip,\" I said, matter-of-factly, \"And then plug you. So you\\'ll be plugged with an hip full of my sperm .\"\\nKat\\'s body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. \"That is so naughty,\" she said huskily. \"I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?\"\\n\"I\\'m not done,\" I said. She raised her eyebrows. \"You have to find a way to mention the word \\'plug\\' on the air .\"\\nShe laughed. \"Oh my god,\" she said. \"That is hot. I\\'ll do it .\"\\n\"I\\'ll be watching,\" I said .\\nOur frequency of anal bed time had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the hip this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal .\\nI watched Kat\\'s broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn\\'t stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, \"Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result .\"\\nMaybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. \"How did I do?\" she asked .\\n\"Perfect, baby,\" I said. \"I\\'m working on your reward right now. It\\'s going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!\"\\n\"What is it?\" she inquired .\\n\"That would ruin the surprise. But let\\'s just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu .\"\\n\\nI began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys\\' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men\\'s basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick\\'s day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other .\\nFrom the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn\\'t really work. I wasn\\'t the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don\\'t get me wrong. I wasn\\'t bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn\\'t prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun .\\nIf the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started . It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn\\'t mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of movement their hosts .\\nI booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat .\\n\"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16,\" I instructed .\\n\"Weekend getaway?\" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji .\\n\"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?\"\\n\"For four days,\" she said .\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the details next time I see you,\" I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture .\\n\"Come over tomorrow?\" she said .\\n\\nI obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat\\'s customary undressed greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my shaft as she kissed me hello .\\n\"Okay, I have been climbing the walls,\" she said. \"You have got to tell me!\"\\n\"What have you figured out so far?\" I asked.\\n\"St. Patrick\\'s Day weekend,\" she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. \"My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can\\'t go too far .\"\\nI smiled. \"I love how smart you are,\" I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn\\'t. My excitement was too great. \"Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late .\"\\nKat squealed in delight. \"Oh my god!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you joking?\"\\n\"Nope,\" I said. \"And dinner at Joel Robuchon .\"\\nHer eyes opened wide. \"No way,\" she said. \"At MGM?\"\\nI nodded. She kissed me. \"I\\'m so wet just thinking about it,\" she said .\\n\"I haven\\'t even told you the plans yet!\" I said .\\n\"They can wait,\" she said. \"I need you inside me .\"\\nWe do it raw and hard. I didn\\'t take long to release and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth private part lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat\\'s thighs .\\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked .\\nMy tongue answered for me, as I licked her release-covered cherry .\\n\"You are such a dirty boy,\" she said. \"You filthy guy, you\\'re going to make me release .\"\\nThat wasn\\'t my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her cherry for the few moments she needed to release again. This was filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the release into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction .\\n\"I am a filthy guy,\" I said. \"I warned you about that. I\\'m your filthy guy .\"\\n\"That was hot!\" Kat said. \"I\\'m going to be craving you all day thinking about it .\"\\nAs she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. \"It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That\\'s when he\\'ll be blackout drunk. He won\\'t suspect anything,\" she said .\\n\"I would say I don\\'t care if he does,\" I said, \"but I do care. A lot. I\\'m not going to jeopardize this .\"\\nWe kissed again, then she asked softly, \"Can we get goodies in Vegas?\"\\nI smiled. \"I have an impeccable source .\"\\n\"You have everything figured out,\" she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. \"This trip is going to be really memorable, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"I\\'m pulling out all the stops,\" I said .\\n\"Do I even want to know?\" she asked .\\nI laughed and said, \"Not if you want to ruin the surprise!\"\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick “Install Now”to download the app and search “79628”to read the full version of the novel.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Read-Novels-fic', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 107983035163694', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '107983035163694', 'ads_count': 49, 'cumulative_ads_count': 140, 'days': '07/09/2022,06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-07 14:09:10,2022-09-06 22:11:07', 'hits': 2, 'search_term': 'smooth,shower'}\n"

Killian Mikaelson is an influential man and i felt so honored to have him in my bar last night. He also gave me more than we bargained\" Madam Pinky laughed happily .\\n\"Killian Mikaelson?\" Disha thought, knowing the name ring a bell but she shrugged it off .\\n\"But, he\\'s kind of creepy\" Disha thought .\\n\"No he\\'s not. You only think so\" Madam Pinky assured Disha who still wore a worried look .\\n\"Is anything wrong? Did he do something to you?\" Madam Pinky asked.\\n\"No..but,\" Disha was saying but was interrupted when Madam Pinky was called .\\n\"We\\'ll talk over the phone honey\"madam Pinky said before hurrying away .\\nShe took two pills and gulped it down with water .\\n\"Don\\'t think you can keep making girls cry and then bribe me with chocolate chip cookies so i won\\'t reprimand you \" Disha said with her mouth full of the cookies .\\nLucien laughed .\\n\"Disha no one can can bribe you into doing what you don\\'t want to. I know you that well\"\\n\"Good for you\" Disha said still chewing her cookies with delight .\\n\"So what did you got for me?\" Lucien said searching her bag .\\n\"I wasn\\'t really in my right frame of mind when coming home\" Disha said .\\n\"Why? And what\\'s this? Who owns this?\" Lucien asked making Disha turn to him .\\n\"What\\'s that?\" She asked not clearly seeing what\\'s in his hand .\\n\"It\\'s a card, i found it in your bag\" Lucien said .\\n\"Card? Wait...you mean card?\" Disha eyes widened as she grabbed the card from him .\\nWhat!\\nThat creepy man slipped the card in her bag .\\nWhat!\\nNow he seems more creepy .\\n\"What\\'s wrong? Lucien asked\\n\"T..his creepy man just asked me to be his daughter\\'s nanny out of the blue\" Disha said reading the information on the card .\\nJust his name and contact with email address .\\n\" A nanny? Who is he? I don\\'t really understand\"\\n\"Ohh but being a nanny is more decent than...\"\\n\"I know\" Disha interrupted him .\\n\"So why don\\'t you opt for it or is the pay little?\"\\n\"No but who would want a..who would want me as their daughter\\'s nanny?\"\\n\"Is that why you said he\\'s creepy?\"\\n\"Well..yes and slipping the card in my bag when i clearly rejected his offer made him more creepy\"\\n\"You should gather information first about whomever you want to be spending the night with. What\\'s his name\"\\n\"It\\'s here, didn\\'t you see it?\" Disha said stretching the card back to Lucien .\\n\"You grabbed the card from me before i could comprehend what\\'s on it .\" Lucien said taking the card from Disha.\\n\"Killian Mikaelson!!\" He suddenly screamed, startling Disha who immediately got on her feet .\\nShe asked starting to tremble in fear while Lucien started laughing hard .\\n\"This guy is a billionaire and a great philanthropist. He\\'s my role model .\" Lucien finally said after much laughter .\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed .\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you know him?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"I also thought the name rang a bell\" Disha said, breathing out in relief .\\nShe sat back on the bed .\\n\"Like, he\\'s the one you spent the night with?\"\\n\"Yes \"\\n\"Wow! You\\'re so lucky nowadays. Didn\\'t you spent the night with Aiden Greenwood two days ago?\" Lucien asked .\\nAiden Greenwood is another billionaire but she knew him immediately she saw him cause he\\'s always on the papers flaunting his money and doing things that attract attention .\\nAlmost everyone knows Aiden Greenwood .\\nWell... isn\\'t that was she is?\\nBut Killian Mikaelson had treated her so differently .\\nWhy?\\n\"Killian Mikaelson asked you to be his daughter\\'s nanny and you refused. Well..I\\'m sure you don\\'t know him well enough. Where\\'s your laptop?\"\\nHe\\'s incredibly dashing .\\n\"Of course,so i guess you\\'ll consider his offer. You\\'re really lucky Disha. So many people are looking for this opportunity\" Lucien said .\\n\" And that\\'s exactly why I\\'ll turn down the offer. He\\'s a billionaire who can get whatever he wants, he can get the best nanny in the country yet he chose me. A worker? Why? Don\\'t you think there\\'s a motive behind it\"\\n\"He just wants to help you Disha\"\\n\"Help me? He already helped me by paying thrice my normal pay\"\\n\"C\\'mon Disha just go for it\"\\n\"No!\"\\n\"Please\"\\n\"I\\'ll not! Now go thrash the card\" Disha said putting off her laptop.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"No further argument!\" Disha half yelled .\\n\"Okay\" Lucien said slowly before walking out of the room with the card in his hand .\\nDisha pulled the blanket over her body and sighed\\nIt\\'s a Saturday!\\nDisha and Lucien move about the house cleaning and washing after serving their stepmother breakfast .\\nDisha cleaned the living room while Lucien cleaned the kitchen .\\nThe doorbell rang twice and Disha quickly walked to the door to get it, thinking it was one of their neighbors .\\nShe opened the door and was a bit surprised to see two huge men putting on a well tailored suit with black eye glass .\\nThey looked scary .\\n\"Good morning\" Their thick voices echoed .\\nDisha shifted back a bit .\\n\"Wrong address\" She said about closing the door .\\n\"Are you Miss Disha David?\" One of the guys asked.\\n\"Y..yes\" She replied .\\n\"Okay, are you ready to leave now?\"\\n\"Leave? To where\" Disha asked puzzled .\\n\"Mr Killian Mikaelson\\'s building, you called yesterday to accept the job offer and said you\\'ll be ready before 10am in the morning. This is 10:01am already\" one of the guys said and the second guy also spoke up before Disha could comprehend what the first guy had said .\\n\" And you gave Mr Killian your home address\"\\n\"What are you saying? I never called! I never said I\\'ll be ready before any freaking 10am in the morning! I never gave Mr Killian my home address! I never did any of that, i even thrashed the ca...\" Disha was yelling when she realised she didn\\'t thrash the card herself .\\nCould Lucien...\\n\"Lucien!!!\" She yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nKillian Mikaelson sigh softly after reading Disha\\'s information .\\nHe couldn\\'t believe he\\'s just reading her information now, something he should have done before even suggesting the nanny job to her .\\n\"I\\'m such a bad father\" Killian said aloud and sipped his favorite drink .\\nThe lady seems calm, beautiful and most of all natural .\\nShe hadn\\'t applied make up yet she looked stunning .\\nHe knew the reason she was doing such work and he\\'s prepared to help her .\\nHe should have just given her money to solve her life issues but she had even wanted to return the extra pay on the money if he hadn\\'t insisted and he knew if he give her a huge amount of money,she\\'s definitely gonna reject it .\\nHe should have offered her a job in one of his companies but she doesn\\'t have a degree and he doesn\\'t know why he wants to keep seeing her everyday .\\nHe wondered why she called him back to accept his offer after clearly rejecting. She didn\\'t even sound pissed knowing he slipped the card in her bag .\\n\\n\"Lucien!!!\" Disha yelled so loud that her throat hurt before rushing back into the house .\\nLucien having sensed what was going on walked out of the kitchen wiping his hands off a napkin .\\nHe knew what he did and he knew his sis will be so pissed but he just had to do it. He does not want her to continue that dirty job .\\n\"What did you do to the card i told you to thrash?\" Disha asked furiously.\\n\"Disha..\"\\n\"Speak up!\" She yelled,her anger growing furiously .\\n\"Okay, i called Mr Killian Mikaelson in your voice and..and told him i already accept the job offer and will like to resume today and i also gave him.. our home address\".\\n\"Y..you did what?\" Disha asked dimming her eyes .\\nSomething she does whenever she\\'s so angry .\\n\"Look Disha, I\\'m sorry\" Lucien said .\\n\"Why did you do that, you knew i did not want to accept that job offer. Why did you go against my wish ?\"\\n\"I just had to do it. I\\'m sorry\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing to be sorry for! You called the man to accept the job offer right? then go ahead and do it!\" Disha scoffed, about to walk away but Lucien pulled her back .\\n\"Disha I\\'m sorry but i don\\'t want you doing that job any longer. You don\\'t know how hurt and guilty i feel seeing you come back looking all tired and used, i always feel angry at myself cause i know you\\'re doing it for me. Disha it\\'s time you stopped. Go for a more decent job please or you\\'ll keep hurting me and making me feel guilty. Please,stop making me think about mum or dad cause i know if they were alive...\" Lucien who rarely cry had unshed tears in his eyes .\\n\"I\\'m sorry\" Disha who was blowing hot minutes ago said calmly .\\nShe was starting to sniff back tears too .\\nShe hates seeing her brother cry and knowing she caused it hurt her so much .\\n\"Don\\'t cry okay? I stopped already\" Lucien said knowing how emotional his sister is .\\nShe nods .\\n\"But you shouldn\\'t have gone behind me and do what i clearly don\\'t want\" Disha said .\\n\"I\\'m sorry, i just wanted something better for you. You deserve something far better than what you\\'re doing .\" Lucien said tucking his sister\\'s long black hair behind her ears .\\n\"No, he has no other motive than to help you and even if he does, i have a smart sister and she\\'ll figure it out in no time\" Lucien smiled .\\nDisha sighed and pressed her lips together .\\n\"He would have told his daughter of a new nanny and i know you won\\'t want to hurt and disappoint the little girl\" Lucien said hoping that\\'ll make Disha reconsider and it did!\\nShe\\'s a lover of kids and she so much hate hurting or disappointing little kids .\\n\"Okay\" She finally said after a long silence .\\n\"Okay what?\" Lucien asked,his stomach starting to dance in excitement .\\n\"I\\'ll go for the nanny job\" Disha said rolling her eyes .\\n\"Oh my God! Really?\" Lucien asked .\\n\"Yeah turtle\" Disha said and Lucien laughed .\\n\"I love you sis\" He said almost sweeping her off her feet with his tight hug .\\nDisha laughed and pushed him away playfully .\\n\"But what of mum?\" Disha asked worriedly .\\n\"Don\\'t worry about mum, I\\'ll take care of her. Now let\\'s go get you dressed,you\\'ve wasted those guys time enough\" Lucien said pulling his sis to her room .\\n\"I already picked out an official outfit while you were sleeping yesternight\"\\n\"What!\" Disha exclaimed while Lucien laughed .\\nDisha and Lucien walked out of Disha\\'s room after she\\'s fully dressed .\\nShe\\'s putting on a black and gold patterned skirt with a striking pattern and a plaid shirt .\\nShe wore minimal black sandals and carried a plain black handbag .\\nHer black hair was pulled in a messy bun with tendrils framing her face .\\nShe wore no make up but still looked great .\\nThey are in need of financial help but not definitely in need of wears .\\nTheir parents were great fashion designers and the children had beautiful clothes that\\'d make people doubt if they are really poor .\\n\"You mean you had to make your voice so tiny while you were talking to Killian Mikaelson\" Disha said still laughing .\\n\"Yes and he didn\\'t even suspect a thing, though it was so hard and i was almost close to talking with my real voice when i quickly gave him our home address and disconnected the call. My throat itched throughout the night\" Lucien faked a frown and Disha laughed hard .\\n*\\n\"We\\'re so sorry for keeping you guys waiting\" Lucien said to the guys when they got to the door .\\nThey both nodded without saying a word .\\n\"Do you think it\\'s safe to go with them?\" Disha whispered to Lucien .\\n\"Of course\" He whispered back .\\nEven when her parents were alive,she never drove in this type of car .\\nThe outer part is so cool that she longed to see the inner part.\\n\"Oh..my! It\\'s a Porsche\" Disha realised .\\nOne of the guys open the car door for her and she smiled secretly feeling like a queen .\\nLucien laughed, watching her from the window .\\nHe knew how his sister was feeling at the moment .\\nHe\\'s glad she finally accepted this better offer .\\nShe\\'s gonna get more pay and the job is far decent .\\nShe won\\'t come back looking tired again, she\\'ll also be happy .\\nLucien smiled and got up when the car drove off .\\nHe walked to the kitchen to complete his chores, totally forgetting about the car plate number .\\n\\nThe car had felt like heaven to Disha and she was almost dozing off when they arrived at Killian Mikaelson mansion .\\nThe car came to a halt inside the compound and the guys alighted to open the car door for Disha .\\n\"What\\'s with the special treatment?\" She thought as she stepped down from the Porsche .\\nShe raised up her head to take a full look at the building and her mouth was left hanging .\\nThe house blinked of riches,the structure alone made her swallow hard .\\nThe tall building stood proud, beautiful and erected .\\nThe perfectly made structures looked beautiful and most of all was the cool gold colour used to paint the whole house .\\nOnce you take a glance at the house, you\\'ll know the owner is swimming in wealth .\\n\"Miss Disha David,can you please come with me\" One of the guys said to Disha who felt embarrassed they had caught her admiring and gaping at the building .\\n\"Okay\" She said slowly and started walking behind him .\\nShe counted the body guards outside and they were up to fifteen .\\nReally??\\nDisha was seated on the couch taking in the lush appearance of the living room .\\nThe inner part of the house smelled more riches .\\nIt\\'s more beautiful than the outer part .\\nThe shiny furnitures are beautifully arranged and the settings is just too great .\\nThe whole living room is far bigger than her entire compound .\\nShe watched the workers move about the house and wondered how many people works in the house .\\nShe stared at the untouched drink in front of her .\\nShe\\'s too nervous to take anything right now .\\n\"Why aren\\'t you taking your drink?\" She heard behind her and her nervousness rose knowing she can\\'t mistake that cool voice for anyone else .\\nShe didn\\'t turn but stood on her feet .\\nKillian stood in front of her and it was then their eyes met .\\nHe looked so cool and comfortable in his white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans .\\nHis hair was rich and full in black curls and the tip glinted like gold .\\nHis golden eyes which was heavily fringed with black lashes stood out proudly against his smooth caramel skin and his nose and mouth just looks perfect .\\nOther than the faint scar on his jaw,his skin was unmarred .\\nHis perfectly built body is very obvious and Disha couldn\\'t help but admire the perfection of his looks .\\nShe wondered why he had to look more handsome now and less creepy .\\n\"Good morning\" Killian spoke up wondering how many minutes they had wasted in staring at each other .\\nHe\\'s impressed by her appearance, looks like she\\'s really ready to work .\\nHe loves it when a lady still look attractive even when she goes all natural .\\nShe\\'s of average height, honey-skinned with satiny black hair and her eyes the color of liquid honey peered into his .\\n\"Good morning Mr Killian Mikaelson\" Disha bowed a little in respect .\\n\"Please do not bow to me. I\\'m not your god\" He said .\\n\"Huh?\" Disha asked in complete surprise .\\n\"Yeah\" Killian said.\\n\"Ohh.. okay\" Disha said biting her inner lip in nervousness .\\nKillian dismissed the workers in the living room and then turned to Disha .\\n\"I\\'m sorry to have slipped my card into your bag\" Killian said .\\n\"Why did you do that when i clearly rejected your offer\" Disha asked .\\n\"But you accepted the offer already\" Killian shrugged .\\n\"I didn\\'t! Lucien freaking did\" Disha thought furiously .\\n\"Yes i did but you\\'ve not answered my question\" Disha said .\\n\"I did that cause i want to help you\"\\n\"Why do you want to help me and do i look like i need help?\" Disha asked determined to make the man know she\\'s not an easy bait .\\n\"Do you probably think I\\'m a dangerous person?\" Killian asked .\\n\"Maybe\" Disha shrugged .\\n\"Then why did you accept to work for me?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t!\" Disha screamed in her inner mind .\\n\"And i hope you don\\'t have the plan to have with me, that would never happen again! I\\'m here to work only as your daughter\\'s nanny and nothing else\" Disha said clearly .\\n\"Hey! Excuse me,i didn\\'t had for five good years and the only reason i crossed your path last two night was because the urge got irresistible. I\\'m not a monger! I\\'m only focused on helping you and if you don\\'t appreciate my help or you think i have any other bad motive you can kindly leave .\" Killian said, the lady is starting to get on his nerves .\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79592\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:11:24', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

He went back to check on her.\\n“Kenneth, you must carry Ken. I can’t go on any longer,” she said, holding her chest with one hand, trying to get her lungs to catch up. Kenneth growled. “No! I won’t leave you. I love you, Lana. Our baby will make it. I will protect you both. I promised, didn’t I? You have to continue. ”\\nHe kissed Lana on her forehead and placed his forehead against hers lovingly. He looked down at the baby; the new revolution of the vampire species. Vampires were not welcomed in these times, not even a half-breed like the child. Most people considered them a threat, and with the rebellion raging, Kenneth had to go on the run to protect the love of his life and their baby.\\n“We must get the baby to Rosa and Allen. They will carry him south as planned, and we will meet them there. ”\\n“I can’t leave him,” Lana said, shaking her head. Kenneth sighed. He knew how she felt, because he felt the same way. However, he had little time to reflect, for his nose caught the scent of hunters close by, his ears detecting the sound of whispered threats in the distance.\\n“We must go now,” he said, swiftly picking Lana up into his arms. “Close your eyes. ” He took off into the night, running with supernatural speed. Lana squeezed the baby in her arms tightly. Kenneth continued to run until he reached an opening in the forest. Rosa and Allen were there, waiting for him as planned.\\n“You finally made it . We’re behind schedule; you should’ve just left the wench,” Allen said. Kenneth growled viciously, warning him to back off.\\n“Give me the baby,” Rosa said, gesturing towards the child . Lana held the baby close to her chest as Kenneth gently placed her on the ground.\\n“Give her the baby, Lana. Everything will be fine. ” He held her as she released the baby to Rosa.\\n“We will see you at the safe house,” Rosa said, trying to soothe Lana. Allen bowed, and then walked away with Rosa, leaving Lana in tears. Kenneth held his love close, trying to keep his emotions at bay while his world crashed down. He prayed for the child’s safety, and his sanity.\\nTwenty-two years later\\n“Hurry up, Teya, or we’re going to be late. ” Teya looked over at her roommate. The frat boys were having a party – one that Teya really wasn’t interested in. She wasn’t the prettiest girl at school – she much rather preferred her space and privacy. She had chosen to live off campus in order to avoid the college life, but tonight she wanted a chance to let go and have fun.\\nShe was heartbroken and alone. Her boyfriend of two years had cheated on her, and had only used her for desire. The only time he was with someone was when he could get between her legs, and that wasn’t who Teya was.\\n“Wow, you look great Leslie,” she said. Leslie did a quick twirl to show off her outfit.\\n“Don’t I know it?” she said, grabbing her friend’s hand. “Let’s go. ” Teya looked around uncertainly, but eventually followed Leslie to the frat house.\\nThe music was booming and the alcohol was pouring. The more Teya saw, the more uncomfortable she became. Leslie had dragged her everywhere, in order to meet everyone. She was a social goddess. The last stop was the bonfire. As Teya looked around, she noticed three ethereal people, two men and a woman, walking out of the darkness, straight towards Leslie.\\n“Good evening,” one of the men announced. He had long black hair that he kept tied in a ponytail, and eyes like fire, that glowed as he bent down to kiss Leslie’s hand. Teya looked over at the woman. She also had straight black hair, as well as the same dangerous fire in her eyes. The other male had short blonde hair, a boyish face, and sky-blue eyes – eyes so beautiful that Teya could get lost in them. He stared at her for a moment, but quickly turned away.\\n“May we join the party? It’s been awhile since I have partied,” the man with long black hair, who appeared to be their leader, asked, speaking with a British accent and followed by a delish smile. Leslie blushed.\\n“Of course. The party is open for everyone. Are you guys from another school? I’ve never seen you guys around here. ”\\n“You can say that,” the blonde guy said. Teya noticed his jaw tightened whenever the leader spoke, as if he was disgusted.\\n“I can grab you guys a drink,” Leslie offered.\\n“That will be delightful,” the leader said, following Leslie to the bar area with the woman, while the blonde one remained and stared at Teya.\\n“Aren’t you going to follow them?” she asked, her heart pounding. Why was he staring at her like that?\\n“As he walked away to catch up with his group, he turned back to her and stated cryptically, “You should watch your neck. ”Teya watched him leave, puzzled. He was clearly the outcast of the three . He almost seemed broken and hurt, like his soul had been ripped out of his body. She felt sadness for the stranger.\\nLater that night, Teya noticed people starting to leave the party. Leslie had walked inside with the strangers, but never came back out. Teya cautiously decided to walk back in to find her friend.\\n“Les?” No answer. “Leslie, let’s go home. The party is over!” she yelled into the bathroom. She decided to walk out to the balcony, in order to get a better view of the bonfire. Out of her peripheral view, she spotted the man and woman carrying Leslie into the woods. She covered her mouth to keep from screaming. They disappeared into the darkness, with nothing but Leslie’s scream echoing through the campus. Teya could see Leslie trying to escape her captors, running back towards the bonfire, but it was hopeless. With a fierce jump, the woman landed perfectly on Leslie’s body and pinned her down. Moving with lightning-fast reflexes, the leader bit Leslie’s neck with his mouth and ripped her throat open while the woman viciously bit her wrists. He looked up towards the balcony while he drank the blood from Leslie’s now-limp body. Teya backed away, her feet fleeing before her body could even respond. The leader looked over at the blonde.\\n“Kill her, Ken,” he said. With a swift motion, Ken jumped onto the balcony as Teya ran for her life. In a panic, she pulled off her shoes before she could trip and threw them behind her, hoping to slow Ken down.\\n“Stop running,” he said, as Teya ran straight into the steel that was the blonde’s chest.\\n“Get away from me!” she screamed. Ken covered her mouth.\\n“Scream. They can hear it. Scream. Then go into the poolroom and stay there until morning,” he stated. Teya looked confused, but only momentarily. He waited until she understood before releasing her mouth. He growled viciously and hurtled himself at her like he was going to attack. Teya screamed and ran. Ken sighed and returned to his comrades Allen and Salina, pretending to wipe his mouth as if there was blood.\\n“I did what you asked. Now give me my freedom. I want to leave,” he declared. Allen grabbed his throat.\\n“You let her go, Ken. I know you did. You will not leave the house. You are still far too weak,” he snarled. Ken didn’t flinch as Allen squeezed his throat harder. His sky blue eyes locked into Allen’s fiery red ones.\\n“You are not my father,” Ken replied, pushing Allen away from him. Allen recovered quickly, using his knee to hit Ken in the stomach, sending him flying into the forest. Before he could even hit a tree, Allen appeared and smashed him into the ground, stomping on his back until blood spilled out.\\n“I’m the only father you have, ever since your real daddy abandoned you,” he said, stomping down on his back . “It’s about time you learn who’s the boss around here. I am all you have. Your father is dead. Deal with it. ” Allen removed his foot from his back and began to walk off. As he left, the woman walked over to him.\\n“Why do you keep defying Allen?” she asked, lovingly grabbing his cheeks to pull him up from the ground. “You must feed, Ken, or you will die. ”\\nKen slapped her hands away. “Just let me be, Salina. ” She pouted as he stood on his own.\\n“I love you, Ken. All you have to do is ask me. I’ll turn you and you’ll be stronger than ever,” she said. Ken growled.\\n“I don’t want this. I don’t want you. Go follow Allen like the hound dog you’ve always been,” he roared. Salina crossed her arms.\\n“ You’ll regret that Ken. I’m only trying to help you. ”\\n“Well don’t,” he said, and with that, Salina disappeared, leaving Ken alone. He had become weak putting up with Allen’s abuse for so long. Salina didn’t understand that he didn’t want this life. He didn’t want to be a killing machine. Twenty-two years had gone by, and the pain was all Ken knew . Salina didn’t love him. Nobody did. Maybe at one point in time he had a loving mother, but he would never know her. He resented his father for handing him over to Allen.\\nHe hated himself for what he was. A half-breed. Part man, part monster. However, his supernatural senses came in handy every now and then. For instance, he could pick up the scent of the girl he was supposed to kill earlier. This time, he would do something right with his curse. He found her in the storage closet inside the poolroom, passed out from the shock. It was becoming day, and Allen and Salina would never know he was gone. He scooped her up and ran with lightning speed to his secret house.\\nTeya woke in a fright. Was everything she witnessed just a bad dream? She couldn’t stop the pounding in her head or the fast rhythm of her heart. She looked around noticing she was not at the frat house or in her apartment. She then saw the blonde from last night sitting next to the window, as if soaking up the afternoon sun. Teya wanted to scream, but she knew screaming would be pointless. She tried to remain calm.\\n“Are you keeping me here for the others to come get me?” she asked, her voice cracking. Only his eyes looked at her as he responded; his head continued to face the window.\\n“I would’ve killed you last night if that were the case. You fainted,” he replied. Teya held her head.\\n“What are you?” she asked. Ken smirked.\\n“I can tell you are afraid. You saw them last night, didn’t you? Monsters, that’s what they are. Vampires,” he replied. Teya looked confused.\\n“I thought vampires couldn’t be in the daylight?” she asked. Ken remained quiet. His arm remained perched on his knee, and his foot was resting on the windowsill. “You’re not like them, are you? But I saw you jump up to the balcony. You have the same speed and unearthly presence. What are you?”\\nKen slowly rose to his feet and walked towards Teya, trying not to alarm her. Before he could control himself, he stumbled weakly. Teya moved towards him hesitantly, but everything in her nature reached out to him. She reached for his shoulder as he crouched with one knee on the ground. He grabbed her wrist quickly, and the hot liquid flowing through her veins called to him. That was the part of himself he hated. He pushed her away.\\n“Just leave,” he said. His voice was raspy and raw. His vampire organs craved blood but he had to resist. He would never harm a human. Not the part of himself he wished to fully become. Teya looked shocked at his response.\\n“I’m sorry. I was just trying to help,” she said. Ken leaned against the bed.\\n“Don’t. I’m dangerous. I am half-vampire. Your blood is calling to me,” he said. Teya swallowed her fear.\\n“So you are still human? Is that why you’re weaker now?” she asked. Ken sighed.\\n“You’re persistent aren’t you?” he replied. Teya wrapped her arms around herself for comfort, slowly sitting on the ground with her knees touching her chest.\\n“I’m afraid. The only way for me calm myself is to understand what it is I’m afraid of,” she said, her voice cracking. “I can’t go home, can I? The police will be swarming the campus. ”\\n“Tell the police the truth. You don’t know anything. If you tell them about Allen and Salina, they will hunt you down and kill you. Either that, or the police will think you are crazy. You don’t want to get involved,” he told her. Tears fell down her cheeks.\\n“I have nowhere else to go,” she cried.\\n“There could be worse things,” Ken said, with such sadness that more tears fell down Teya’s face. “You’re alive. Allen wouldn’t hesitate to kill if he found out about you. ”\\nTeya shivered. “Is he the leader or something? He looked so evil. I saw what he did to Leslie. He tore her apart. ”\\nKen shifted his weight to his other leg uncomfortably. The mentioning of Allen had put him on edge.\\n“Allen is nothing to do with. He is an ancient, and he has no heart or soul. He won’t hesitate to kill anyone,” he said, standing abruptly. He unbuttoned his shirt and removed it with one smooth motion. Teya gasped and turned away before her blush revealed itself on her face. Ken smirked.\\n“Are you alright?” he teased.\\n“Yes,” she replied shyly. Ken walked over to and squatted in so they were face-to-face. Teya met his gaze. His deep-blue eyes pierced her light brown ones. A huge mistake, because now she was lost.\\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he whispered. Even his voice pierced her skin, causing her to shiver. He grabbed her shaking hands and placed them over his beating heart. It was only after she got over the fact her hands were touching his smooth pectorals that she felt something odd. There was a slow rhythm, almost like his heart was failing.\\n“Your heart beat is”\\n“The human organs are slowly being consumed by the vampire’s hunger,” he interrupted, releasing her hands and standing up.\\n“What do you eat, then?” Teya asked, following him into the kitchen as he put on his shirt.\\n“Fruits and veggies on a good day, nothing else is sustaining enough for me at the moment. The older I grow, the weaker I become. I may even die. ”\\n“No, don’t say that. You should just stay away from Allen and any other vampire, and try something else. ”\\n“I wish it was that easy, but it isn’t,” he whispered, leaning against the counter.\\n“Do you do this often?” she asked, snapping Ken out of his trance.\\n“Do what?”\\n“Save women and bring them back to your place?”\\nKen smiled. She was straightforward, even in her fear. “Not jealous are you?” he teased.\\n“No! Of course not! Just wondering if you were some kind of superhero or something, rescuing damsels in distress?” she quickly retorted, walking around the kitchen and touching the cabinets as if studying the material. Ken found himself admiring her, engulfing her intoxicating scent . It was more than just her blood calling to him. Ken realized it had been awhile since he’d been this close to a person. She smelled wild and pure. Ken’s heart began to beat a little bit faster.\\nGN *2“The sun will be setting soon. You should go. I’ll call you a cab. It’ll be harder for them to track you this way,” Ken said, grabbing his cell phone.\\n“Them?” Teya asked, looking worried. “There’s more than just Allen and Salina?”\\nKen nodded. “Lots more. This is why we can’t see each other again. I’m sorry I’ve brought you this far. ”\\nTeya wanted to protest, but she knew he was right. This was dangerous. They couldn’t be friends. The cab honked outside twenty minutes later as they sat in silence for a while. . Ken opened the door for her without saying a word. Teya grabbed his hand and kissed him on the cheek bravely.\\n“Thank you,” she said. He watched her hop into the cab and drive away into the sunset. The spot on his jaw where she’d kissed him burned from her soft lips. Ken groaned in frustration and stepped back into his apartment of loneliness. He paced the room until darkness fell. The moon was high in the sky. He sucked in a huge breath, trying to prepare himself for what was to come once he left the comfort of his home to on the other side of town.\\nThe abandoned house on the other side of town, where no one dared to enter or even drive by due to rumors of its haunting, was where the vampires slept. The house truly was haunted to Ken. There was much dread in the house. He’d lived in the house for as long as he could remember. There were no happy times – only training and fear. No love, no childhood, only hatred for Allen, every second he was in his presence. He blamed his father for this oppression, and had grown to hate him as well.\\nHe walked into the house just before they rose from their coffins to feed and terrorize. Ken sat at the old table with a bottle of water. His mind was not focused. He was as still as a statue as he stared into the depths of darkness. His cheek still burned, even though he made sure to clean his face. Her scent was still embedded in his nose, wheezing its way through his thoughts. The bottle was suddenly knocked across the room by a powerful force, taking out the table as well. Ken only moved his eyes to stare at the attacker. He was thinking clearly now, and he noticed everything in his surroundings.\\n“I don’t understand why you drink that human trash, Ken,” Salina said, folding her arms. A low growl rumbled in Ken’s chest. Allen entered the room, fixing his tie. Ken never looked back at him, but he knew he was there. He could always sense that dark, brooding aura. Bile rose in his stomach in disgust.\\n“Yes, Ken, it\\'s very like you to cater to that weak side of you. You know I don’t allow any of that in my house,” Allen said, speaking fairly normal. There was no anger or forceful tone in his voice. He didn’t beat him this time for disobeying. Something was up. Allen was in a good mood, and that meant destruction to all. Allen’s good mood caused explosions and thousands of dead bodies. . Ken stood up, with no rush in his movements. He walked right by Allen, heading for the door. Allen stopped him by grabbing his shoulders. Ken and Allen stood face-to-face, both at 6’4 and made of pure muscle. They stared in each other’s eyes, neither flinching, both deadly. Ken’s shoulder felt like maggots crawling.\\n“You smell sweet,” Allen taunted, sniffing the air.\\n“The woman I fed on last night,” Ken lied, trying to keep his heart from beating too loudly. He suddenly felt scared for Teya, but kept his voice and emotions numb. Allen squeezed Ken’s shoulder until it cracked. Ken didn’t flinch. As always, he took the pain.\\n“You didn’t kill her, did you?” Allen asked. Ken\\'s eyes glinted with menace, and he pushed Allen’s arm away forcefully.\\n“Leave it alone,” he growled, grinding his teeth.\\n“You are so weak. You shame me,” Allen snarled, crouching to attack.\\n“Stop it!” A woman with a Spanish accent cried, who walked into the kitchen. “What’s going on in here?”\\n“Stay out of this, Rosa. This trash is so weak, he let a human go,” Allen roared. Rosa looked over at Ken who turned away from her.\\n“Allen, go feed with Salina. I’ll take care of Ken,” she said. Allen straightened up before the only person who could stand up to him without consequence. He fixed his clothes in the proper way sophisticated men did before speaking.\\n“Let’s go, Salina,” he said, never taking his eyes off Ken. “I’ll deal with you when I get back. ” He walked away, feeling Ken’s eyes burning his back as he left.\\n“Ken, stop taunting him,” Rosa said. Ken shook his head.\\n“I can’t be here anymore Rosa. I hate him. I hate this. ” He kicked the already-broken table. “I’m leaving. ”\\n“I won’t stop you. I don’t blame you, either,” she said. Ken looked back at her now. She smiled and grabbed his cheeks. “You are growing up so fast. Allen knows he won’t be able to control you for long. That’s why he has been so hard on you lately. Just give it time, ok?”\\nWithout another word, Ken walked right past her and into the night. His first thought was Teya. He knew the police would\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nClick to install our app and continue reading for more chapters by searching for Book ID \"79776\".', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Fun-Novels4518', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 116792607687104', 'page_likes': 24, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '116792607687104', 'ads_count': 210, 'cumulative_ads_count': 938, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:11:40', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

I opened it and saw him looking at the two laptops on the table that was on the side. The laptop was wired to the CCTVs .\\n\"You\\'re calling me?\" why am I stuttering? He took a deep breath and stared at me. He looked at the tray I was carrying. I cleared my throat and approached his desk and landed in the vacant space there .\\nI couldn\\'t look at him so I looked around his room .\\nSofa set in front of flatscreen tv. There is a table here with a swivel chair. A king-size bed covered by a black cushion. also, black colored carpet lying on the floor. In one word. ‘Manly’ is really his room .\\nI was just standing there by his side. He leaned back in his swivel chair and he applied his back to its backrest. He looked tired but so handsome. I mean, no words can explain his appearance. There is nothing wrong with our race .\\n\"Why you are late? I cook your favorite .” He asked that I was simply tired of looking. I want to be embarrassed .\\n\"We have a practice for the prom ..\" I explained. Maybe papa will keep an eye on me. He nodded and played a game of his hand lip. I looked at his lips for a moment and immediately avoided...He smirked and licked his lips ... am I obvious?\\nHe stood up so I looked up because of his stature. He took a step towards me .\\n\"Four more nights you were late coming home .\" every step he takes forward he is my back. Gosh..what is he doing?\\nI blinked as I couldn\\'t look at him directly. Then three more thrusts..he was my back. I immediately felt the cold wall. Dead end .\\n\"Who drives you here?\" he asked seriously but I don\\'t think I heard. The noise of my heart rate overcame me more. I was just stunned when he bowed slightly so we could line up. He put his both hands on either side of my head...\\nI cursed a million in my mind. I am nervous. The speed of my heartbeat. I took a deep breath. I forgot our distance just a few feet away. The heat of her body seemed to attract me.\\n\"Distance, please! I can\\'t breathe,” I said coldly to him and pushed him slightly but he was harder he didn\\'t move .\\n\"Shall I repeat my question Roxette?\" I could hear the anger in his voice there .\\nI gritted my teeth with so much emotion. \"Why? Why are you asking? Because dad asked you? me that you should watch? Your sweet uncle then. \"\\nHis jaw clenched. The vein came out of his arm because his fist was already clenched on my side. I was nervous because of that .\\nHe leaned closer. His nose was so close to mine. Just a little movement will apply to our lips. Does he know what he is doing?\\n\"I\\'m watching you the way I want. I don\\'t need anyone else\\'s notice. Now, answer me. Who is that? Boyfriend?\"\\nI stared at him. \"he\\'s Simon. A friend, not a boyfriend. \"I focused my gaze on his lips. It was nice to pull the nape and kiss him. oh! It\\'s justice to me! Why is this handsome creature, my uncle? He suddenly bit his lips so I turned around and looked into his eyes .\\nHis hand touches my lips ..\"Who\\'s your first kiss?\" He asked huskily in a cold voice .\\nI swallowed and shook. \"Nothing yet ..\"\\nBut I remember the one on the veranda. His lips slightly touched my lips then. But just a little! I don\\'t know if it was the first kiss?\\nHe nodded briefly. \"What if ....\" he tucked some strand of my hair in my ear .\\n\"I kiss you right now? What will you do?\" He whispered that only the two of us could hear .\\nI was shocked as if my whole being shaken at what he said. What! I bit my trembling lips and looked at his lips again. hmm..inviting .. what does it taste like? So soft?\\nHis kiss on my cheek made me close and he slowly moved his lips closer to mine. My leg shook as his lips lightly touched mine. He pressed my waist. But my lips were not completely covered when there was a knock on the door .\\nI took a deep breath and pushed him. He seemed to have poured cold water on my body. Oh my god ...\\nI covered my lips as he looked up and covered his forehead as if angry .\\n\"Who\\'s that ?!\" he shouted .\\n\"Ah, Sir! ! Here\\'s what you\\'re asking for from the boutique ...\" said the maid outside the door .\\nSav walked there while I was looking for a captain because I thought I would collapse. I raised my hand on the table and rewind in my mind what happened. I heard the door close so I looked up. He has two boxes that are large and one that is small .\\nhe handed it to me. \"For you...\"\\nI blinked and took it. \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"Open it ..\"! his husky voice .. insane voice... He\\'s really my ideal man. I laid it on the table and took off the ribbon that was rolled up in the big box .\\nI gasped in surprise. It\\'s a cocktail dress!\\n\"Oh my god..it\\'s beautiful!\" I gasped in awe. How did he know that the cocktail dress was the motif at our prom? Gosh .\\nHe nodded. It was gray with glitters. That tube type but no cleavage. It\\'s just straight, not V neck. Seems like I don’t want to show my chest? It\\'s really super nice. It fits me even if I just look. I also took off the roll of a box and found those silver stilettos! nice!\\nI smiled and looked at him. \"Thank you, really!\" He bit his lip as he looked at me. A hint of amusement plastered on his face .\\n\"All for you..baby ..\"\\nChapter 6\\nIt was a big mistake. The attraction I feel for Sav. Many handsome flirts with me, but why with my uncle? What kind of heart do I have? Tsk. I buried it all in oblivion, I also don\\'t know why he moves the same way towards me? He even asked me what if he will be my first kiss?\\nWhen that incident ended two days ago. Everything became normal. Sometimes we share breakfast. He was just cold. He always has a cellphone call that he calls babe. He also comes home at night once, he is drunk. That hurts my heart, I think my heart is abnormal .\\nOf course, it\\'s wrong to like him, my uncle. That was the most painful part of me. just really unfair. But, I will try my best. So, hard to keep this feeling. I know I can find a man for me too, but I\\'m not ready yet, fling will do .\\nWe are in the MOA now. I went with my driver because I don\\'t know how to drive yet and because it\\'s still forbidden for someone like me who is seventeen years old. I really don\\'t want to go with the driver once in a while because Jezel went to see us a lot .\\nWe came from practicing folk dance at school and we went straight here because we have something to buy for tomorrow. It\\'s the last day of our practice today and our prom is coming...\\n\"Did you tell Gerald that his necktie should be gray?\" Jezel asked me. Gerald was my partner at the prom. He’s a nerd. I prefer him to the others who are too smooth. Gerald isn\\'t ugly, he\\'s really just a need to look at because of his big glasses. Gray and black is the motif of our prom. So my cocktail gown is gray so Gerald and I should have a suit .\\n\"Yep!\" I answer and look at the VS perfumes lined up. One of the perfumes in my collection. I took the night\\'s seduction and smelled it. The scent was really nice!\\n\"Will you be picked up?\"\\nI shook. \"Uncle Savier will drive me .\" note the sarcasm in uncle\\'s word. He said he would take me. He was also invited because he is one of the sponsors of St. Dominic.\\n\"Wow. The sweet one .\"\\nI stared at him. \"Shut up .\" I also choose dark red lipsticks. because my other lipstick is pink, so it\\'s different. Jezel is just next to me and asking .\\n\"Maybe they\\'re Miss Ocampo?\" I stopped at his question. Yeah, those past days. He always goes to school and picks up Miss Ocampo. Our New English school teacher. she\\'s pretty, matured, and an ideal girl. That’s why I spend time practicing to avoid being non -judgmental .\\nI have no right to get mad. Whoever he wants, I can do nothing but support him. That\\'s my role being his niece .\\n\"Who cares? They\\'re something .\" I said bitterly and took the purchases and went straight to the counter while Jez was just tailing .\\n\"E \\'why do you seem sad? Tss! I told you Rox, move on. That feeling will kill you!\" She whispered to me as I paid. After being paid I walked out. I did not answer Jez. My chest tightens. That\\'s why I\\'m avoiding it .\\n\"Rox! Sorry! Are you mad?\" Jez chased me .\\nI smiled bitterly as we exited. \"I\\'m trying Jez. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let my uncle hurt me .\" She took a deep breath and put her arm around me.\\n“Just. I’m only here when you\\'re sad. Hmm? \"\\nI rolled my eyes. \"You\\'re a drama!\"\\n\"Chee, I don\\'t know about you .\" We laughed as we got into the car. I just finished dinner and entered the room. Since I was excited about the prom I prepared everything I would need. the cocktail gown I hung on the hanger and placed in the closet. The stilleto. The makeup is all set. The earring, bracelet, and contact lens, etc. I was stunned to hear Sav’s car just arrived. It\\'s nine o\\'clock and he\\'ll just arrive?\\nI took a deep breath and thought he might not have eaten yet. So I went down because I knew the two helpers were asleep. Going down the stairs, the door suddenly opened and Sav entered, apparently drunk but still smiling. My attention was divided when I saw a woman leading him. or I must say, It’s miss Ocampo .\\nIt turned white dress with flowers. The body is curved and high heels are still on .\\n\"Where\\'s your room babe?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Where\\'s your room2x?”Tsk. Sav\\'s smile on Miss Ocampo\\'s body was so close that it gave my heart pain. Before they could go up. I sneezed .\\nThey both stopped and I saw Sav look at me seriously. no more naughtiness. Well... I\\'m just assuming too much. Why would the uncle be sweet to his niece? And when else was it legal for the uncle to kiss his niece? It\\'s a sin!\\n\"Why are you here Miss Ocampo?\" I asked formally .\\nShe suddenly formalized. \"Hmm...Sav was drunk so I supported him .\" I nodded so that Sav could almost fall asleep on her shoulder .\\n\"Any help? Because he\\'s heavy .\" She added. I had no choice but to help them. Why is he so drunk?\\n\"-Why is he drunk miss?\" I asked as Sav landed on the bed. He groaned as his back pressed against the bed. He’s just wearing a gray T-shirt and pants .\\nMiss Ocampo shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. He drank l the spirits would be like water. Hmm..by the way, does he live here?\" She asked .\\nI nodded. \"I\\'ll just get some lukewarm water .\"\\nI quickly went to the kitchen and got lukewarm water and filled it with liquor. I also took a wipe. I was annoyed because another woman entered his room. stop it Rox. He\\'s your uncle! He already has a girlfriend!\\nMy chest tightened as I went back upstairs to his bedroom. I opened the door and shuddered at where I stood. My innocent eyes! Miss Ocampo is already on Sav\\'s lap. We\\'re kissing torridly. Miss Ocampo\\'s tube dress had fallen off and Sav was already taking off his t-shirt. He held Miss Ocampo\\'s waist and caressed her butt! They were groaning and moaning...\\nI was cold and shivering as the bowl of lukewarm water I was holding collapsed. They immediately separated and stopped. Miss Ocampo immediately left Sav’s lap .\\nI didn\\'t look at them and just bowed. \"I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t know I\\'m sorry!\" I close my eyes and immediately turn around before they can see my tears. I immediately ran to my room and locked it. I ran to sit on the floor on the side of the bed and leaned back on the bed .\\nI was caught in my chest tightening and I could barely breathe. My sobs echoed in the four corners of my room. I wiped away my tears .\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be hurt!\" I built a cup on my chest. “I hate this F-feeling ! I hate my h-heart! \"\\nI was stopped by a knock on the door from outside. \"Rox! Open the door!\" Sav\\'s hoarse cry. Only in its voice will you know that it has been drunk .\\nI remained silent and sobbed. I was speechless. I\\'ve seen him bring a woman here a few times but it hurts more to see what they\\'re doing .\\nI stopped and was even more nervous when the door suddenly opened. What? I locked it! Sav came in, still topless and holding a key. That\\'s why. I averted my eyes when I saw his anticipating look. His eyes were bulging and he was obviously drunk. I can’t look at his handsome body and has eight abs. Darn. He took a deep breath and I could see his footsteps approaching .\\nI closed my eyes firmly with my heart pounding. the crash that I only feel when he\\'s there. His effect on my heart was really strange. This is so bad. He bowed in front of me. One knee was kneeling on the floor and the other was raised and placed his arm there .\\n\"Let\\'s talk,\" he said hoarsely. I immediately inhaled the smell of his breath mixed with mint and liquor. I opened my eyes and my tears flowed. His palm rose and wiped away my tears which I immediately avoided .\\n\"Don\\'t touch me. Just talk .\" I said coldly .\\nHe heaved and sighed. \"Okay ..\" he raised his hand to my side. I hugged my knee .\\n\"Why did you follow? What about your girlfriend?\" I asked. It was hoarse from crying and trembling .\\n\"Who won\\'t follow if you\\'re crying?\" He insisted. His jaw clamped dangerously. He seemed to have lost his drunkenness .\\n“You care ?!” I Spat. \"Don\\'t pretend, please. I\\'m fine. Go away .\" New tears flowed. I bit my trembling lips .\\n\"Why are you crying?\" Instead, he asked. Why? Should I tell the truth? It was as if I had just put myself in harm\\'s way .\\n\"Go aways! you dirty man! Go away! \"I shouted and slapped him on the face and chest. I didn\\'t care if his handsome face got hurt. He didn\\'t stop me, he just let me go. Until I got tired of the beating. His face was red. and I did not even bear my blow to him. He\\'s massive and strong. So maybe that\\'s just not in him .\\n\"You\\'re done?\" He parted the strand of hair on my face. I shunned .\\n\"I hate you!\"\\nHe nodded .\\n\"Why are you crying? May I know why?\" He asked softly .\\n\"Because I hate you,\" I answered immediately. He grabbed my chin and faced him. His dark and expressive eyes were really beautiful. The thick eyebrows and sharp nose. His naturally red lips. He\\'s perfect .\\n\"Hating your uncle is normal. Do you know what\\'s wrong? the wrong is if you love more than a normal love. Not as an uncle, but as a man. ” I stiffened in my seat .\\nThose past years there was no such partnership with us. He always makes business trips abroad. And busy at work. I bit my lip and bowed. My chest is pounding. What does he mean? Am I too obvious?\\n“Did you know I’m ready to fight the whole world for someone? Do you know I’m just waiting for the chance to let her know how I feel? I will fight for us. Even if this family breaks up. \" He said seriously. He looked straight into my eyes .\\n\"W-What are you saying?\" I whispered .\\nHe leaned closer and kissed my forehead and my nose ... then he stops. \"If I will ask you, to run away with me... Would you?\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79577\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:11:56', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:12:12', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

I opened it and saw him looking at the two laptops on the table that was on the side. The laptop was wired to the CCTVs .\\n\"You\\'re calling me?\" why am I stuttering? He took a deep breath and stared at me. He looked at the tray I was carrying. I cleared my throat and approached his desk and landed in the vacant space there .\\nI couldn\\'t look at him so I looked around his room .\\nSofa set in front of flatscreen tv. There is a table here with a swivel chair. A king-size bed covered by a black cushion. also, black colored carpet lying on the floor. In one word. ‘Manly’ is really his room .\\nI was just standing there by his side. He leaned back in his swivel chair and he applied his back to its backrest. He looked tired but so handsome. I mean, no words can explain his appearance. There is nothing wrong with our race .\\n\"Why you are late? I cook your favorite .” He asked that I was simply tired of looking. I want to be embarrassed .\\n\"We have a practice for the prom ..\" I explained. Maybe papa will keep an eye on me. He nodded and played a game of his hand lip. I looked at his lips for a moment and immediately avoided...He smirked and licked his lips ... am I obvious?\\nHe stood up so I looked up because of his stature. He took a step towards me .\\n\"Four more nights you were late coming home .\" every step he takes forward he is my back. Gosh..what is he doing?\\nI blinked as I couldn\\'t look at him directly. Then three more thrusts..he was my back. I immediately felt the cold wall. Dead end .\\n\"Who drives you here?\" he asked seriously but I don\\'t think I heard. The noise of my heart rate overcame me more. I was just stunned when he bowed slightly so we could line up. He put his both hands on either side of my head...\\nI cursed a million in my mind. I am nervous. The speed of my heartbeat. I took a deep breath. I forgot our distance just a few feet away. The heat of her body seemed to attract me.\\n\"Distance, please! I can\\'t breathe,” I said coldly to him and pushed him slightly but he was harder he didn\\'t move .\\n\"Shall I repeat my question Roxette?\" I could hear the anger in his voice there .\\nI gritted my teeth with so much emotion. \"Why? Why are you asking? Because dad asked you? me that you should watch? Your sweet uncle then. \"\\nHis jaw clenched. The vein came out of his arm because his fist was already clenched on my side. I was nervous because of that .\\nHe leaned closer. His nose was so close to mine. Just a little movement will apply to our lips. Does he know what he is doing?\\n\"I\\'m watching you the way I want. I don\\'t need anyone else\\'s notice. Now, answer me. Who is that? Boyfriend?\"\\nI stared at him. \"he\\'s Simon. A friend, not a boyfriend. \"I focused my gaze on his lips. It was nice to pull the nape and kiss him. oh! It\\'s justice to me! Why is this handsome creature, my uncle? He suddenly bit his lips so I turned around and looked into his eyes .\\nHis hand touches my lips ..\"Who\\'s your first kiss?\" He asked huskily in a cold voice .\\nI swallowed and shook. \"Nothing yet ..\"\\nBut I remember the one on the veranda. His lips slightly touched my lips then. But just a little! I don\\'t know if it was the first kiss?\\nHe nodded briefly. \"What if ....\" he tucked some strand of my hair in my ear .\\n\"I kiss you right now? What will you do?\" He whispered that only the two of us could hear .\\nI was shocked as if my whole being shaken at what he said. What! I bit my trembling lips and looked at his lips again. hmm..inviting .. what does it taste like? So soft?\\nHis kiss on my cheek made me close and he slowly moved his lips closer to mine. My leg shook as his lips lightly touched mine. He pressed my waist. But my lips were not completely covered when there was a knock on the door .\\nI took a deep breath and pushed him. He seemed to have poured cold water on my body. Oh my god ...\\nI covered my lips as he looked up and covered his forehead as if angry .\\n\"Who\\'s that ?!\" he shouted .\\n\"Ah, Sir! ! Here\\'s what you\\'re asking for from the boutique ...\" said the maid outside the door .\\nSav walked there while I was looking for a captain because I thought I would collapse. I raised my hand on the table and rewind in my mind what happened. I heard the door close so I looked up. He has two boxes that are large and one that is small .\\nhe handed it to me. \"For you...\"\\nI blinked and took it. \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"Open it ..\"! his husky voice .. insane voice... He\\'s really my ideal man. I laid it on the table and took off the ribbon that was rolled up in the big box .\\nI gasped in surprise. It\\'s a cocktail dress!\\n\"Oh my god..it\\'s beautiful!\" I gasped in awe. How did he know that the cocktail dress was the motif at our prom? Gosh .\\nHe nodded. It was gray with glitters. That tube type but no cleavage. It\\'s just straight, not V neck. Seems like I don’t want to show my chest? It\\'s really super nice. It fits me even if I just look. I also took off the roll of a box and found those silver stilettos! nice!\\nI smiled and looked at him. \"Thank you, really!\" He bit his lip as he looked at me. A hint of amusement plastered on his face .\\n\"All for you..baby ..\"\\nChapter 6\\nIt was a big mistake. The attraction I feel for Sav. Many handsome flirts with me, but why with my uncle? What kind of heart do I have? Tsk. I buried it all in oblivion, I also don\\'t know why he moves the same way towards me? He even asked me what if he will be my first kiss?\\nWhen that incident ended two days ago. Everything became normal. Sometimes we share breakfast. He was just cold. He always has a cellphone call that he calls babe. He also comes home at night once, he is drunk. That hurts my heart, I think my heart is abnormal .\\nOf course, it\\'s wrong to like him, my uncle. That was the most painful part of me. just really unfair. But, I will try my best. So, hard to keep this feeling. I know I can find a man for me too, but I\\'m not ready yet, fling will do .\\nWe are in the MOA now. I went with my driver because I don\\'t know how to drive yet and because it\\'s still forbidden for someone like me who is seventeen years old. I really don\\'t want to go with the driver once in a while because Jezel went to see us a lot .\\nWe came from practicing folk dance at school and we went straight here because we have something to buy for tomorrow. It\\'s the last day of our practice today and our prom is coming...\\n\"Did you tell Gerald that his necktie should be gray?\" Jezel asked me. Gerald was my partner at the prom. He’s a nerd. I prefer him to the others who are too smooth. Gerald isn\\'t ugly, he\\'s really just a need to look at because of his big glasses. Gray and black is the motif of our prom. So my cocktail gown is gray so Gerald and I should have a suit .\\n\"Yep!\" I answer and look at the VS perfumes lined up. One of the perfumes in my collection. I took the night\\'s seduction and smelled it. The scent was really nice!\\n\"Will you be picked up?\"\\nI shook. \"Uncle Savier will drive me .\" note the sarcasm in uncle\\'s word. He said he would take me. He was also invited because he is one of the sponsors of St. Dominic.\\n\"Wow. The sweet one .\"\\nI stared at him. \"Shut up .\" I also choose dark red lipsticks. because my other lipstick is pink, so it\\'s different. Jezel is just next to me and asking .\\n\"Maybe they\\'re Miss Ocampo?\" I stopped at his question. Yeah, those past days. He always goes to school and picks up Miss Ocampo. Our New English school teacher. she\\'s pretty, matured, and an ideal girl. That’s why I spend time practicing to avoid being non -judgmental .\\nI have no right to get mad. Whoever he wants, I can do nothing but support him. That\\'s my role being his niece .\\n\"Who cares? They\\'re something .\" I said bitterly and took the purchases and went straight to the counter while Jez was just tailing .\\n\"E \\'why do you seem sad? Tss! I told you Rox, move on. That feeling will kill you!\" She whispered to me as I paid. After being paid I walked out. I did not answer Jez. My chest tightens. That\\'s why I\\'m avoiding it .\\n\"Rox! Sorry! Are you mad?\" Jez chased me .\\nI smiled bitterly as we exited. \"I\\'m trying Jez. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let my uncle hurt me .\" She took a deep breath and put her arm around me.\\n“Just. I’m only here when you\\'re sad. Hmm? \"\\nI rolled my eyes. \"You\\'re a drama!\"\\n\"Chee, I don\\'t know about you .\" We laughed as we got into the car. I just finished dinner and entered the room. Since I was excited about the prom I prepared everything I would need. the cocktail gown I hung on the hanger and placed in the closet. The stilleto. The makeup is all set. The earring, bracelet, and contact lens, etc. I was stunned to hear Sav’s car just arrived. It\\'s nine o\\'clock and he\\'ll just arrive?\\nI took a deep breath and thought he might not have eaten yet. So I went down because I knew the two helpers were asleep. Going down the stairs, the door suddenly opened and Sav entered, apparently drunk but still smiling. My attention was divided when I saw a woman leading him. or I must say, It’s miss Ocampo .\\nIt turned white dress with flowers. The body is curved and high heels are still on .\\n\"Where\\'s your room babe?\" She asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Where\\'s your room2x?”Tsk. Sav\\'s smile on Miss Ocampo\\'s body was so close that it gave my heart pain. Before they could go up. I sneezed .\\nThey both stopped and I saw Sav look at me seriously. no more naughtiness. Well... I\\'m just assuming too much. Why would the uncle be sweet to his niece? And when else was it legal for the uncle to kiss his niece? It\\'s a sin!\\n\"Why are you here Miss Ocampo?\" I asked formally .\\nShe suddenly formalized. \"Hmm...Sav was drunk so I supported him .\" I nodded so that Sav could almost fall asleep on her shoulder .\\n\"Any help? Because he\\'s heavy .\" She added. I had no choice but to help them. Why is he so drunk?\\n\"-Why is he drunk miss?\" I asked as Sav landed on the bed. He groaned as his back pressed against the bed. He’s just wearing a gray T-shirt and pants .\\nMiss Ocampo shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. He drank l the spirits would be like water. Hmm..by the way, does he live here?\" She asked .\\nI nodded. \"I\\'ll just get some lukewarm water .\"\\nI quickly went to the kitchen and got lukewarm water and filled it with liquor. I also took a wipe. I was annoyed because another woman entered his room. stop it Rox. He\\'s your uncle! He already has a girlfriend!\\nMy chest tightened as I went back upstairs to his bedroom. I opened the door and shuddered at where I stood. My innocent eyes! Miss Ocampo is already on Sav\\'s lap. We\\'re kissing torridly. Miss Ocampo\\'s tube dress had fallen off and Sav was already taking off his t-shirt. He held Miss Ocampo\\'s waist and caressed her butt! They were groaning and moaning...\\nI was cold and shivering as the bowl of lukewarm water I was holding collapsed. They immediately separated and stopped. Miss Ocampo immediately left Sav’s lap .\\nI didn\\'t look at them and just bowed. \"I-I\\'m sorry. I-I don\\'t know I\\'m sorry!\" I close my eyes and immediately turn around before they can see my tears. I immediately ran to my room and locked it. I ran to sit on the floor on the side of the bed and leaned back on the bed .\\nI was caught in my chest tightening and I could barely breathe. My sobs echoed in the four corners of my room. I wiped away my tears .\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be hurt!\" I built a cup on my chest. “I hate this F-feeling ! I hate my h-heart! \"\\nI was stopped by a knock on the door from outside. \"Rox! Open the door!\" Sav\\'s hoarse cry. Only in its voice will you know that it has been drunk .\\nI remained silent and sobbed. I was speechless. I\\'ve seen him bring a woman here a few times but it hurts more to see what they\\'re doing .\\nI stopped and was even more nervous when the door suddenly opened. What? I locked it! Sav came in, still topless and holding a key. That\\'s why. I averted my eyes when I saw his anticipating look. His eyes were bulging and he was obviously drunk. I can’t look at his handsome body and has eight abs. Darn. He took a deep breath and I could see his footsteps approaching .\\nI closed my eyes firmly with my heart pounding. the crash that I only feel when he\\'s there. His effect on my heart was really strange. This is so bad. He bowed in front of me. One knee was kneeling on the floor and the other was raised and placed his arm there .\\n\"Let\\'s talk,\" he said hoarsely. I immediately inhaled the smell of his breath mixed with mint and liquor. I opened my eyes and my tears flowed. His palm rose and wiped away my tears which I immediately avoided .\\n\"Don\\'t touch me. Just talk .\" I said coldly .\\nHe heaved and sighed. \"Okay ..\" he raised his hand to my side. I hugged my knee .\\n\"Why did you follow? What about your girlfriend?\" I asked. It was hoarse from crying and trembling .\\n\"Who won\\'t follow if you\\'re crying?\" He insisted. His jaw clamped dangerously. He seemed to have lost his drunkenness .\\n“You care ?!” I Spat. \"Don\\'t pretend, please. I\\'m fine. Go away .\" New tears flowed. I bit my trembling lips .\\n\"Why are you crying?\" Instead, he asked. Why? Should I tell the truth? It was as if I had just put myself in harm\\'s way .\\n\"Go aways! you dirty man! Go away! \"I shouted and slapped him on the face and chest. I didn\\'t care if his handsome face got hurt. He didn\\'t stop me, he just let me go. Until I got tired of the beating. His face was red. and I did not even bear my blow to him. He\\'s massive and strong. So maybe that\\'s just not in him .\\n\"You\\'re done?\" He parted the strand of hair on my face. I shunned .\\n\"I hate you!\"\\nHe nodded .\\n\"Why are you crying? May I know why?\" He asked softly .\\n\"Because I hate you,\" I answered immediately. He grabbed my chin and faced him. His dark and expressive eyes were really beautiful. The thick eyebrows and sharp nose. His naturally red lips. He\\'s perfect .\\n\"Hating your uncle is normal. Do you know what\\'s wrong? the wrong is if you love more than a normal love. Not as an uncle, but as a man. ” I stiffened in my seat .\\nThose past years there was no such partnership with us. He always makes business trips abroad. And busy at work. I bit my lip and bowed. My chest is pounding. What does he mean? Am I too obvious?\\n“Did you know I’m ready to fight the whole world for someone? Do you know I’m just waiting for the chance to let her know how I feel? I will fight for us. Even if this family breaks up. \" He said seriously. He looked straight into my eyes .\\n\"W-What are you saying?\" I whispered .\\nHe leaned closer and kissed my forehead and my nose ... then he stops. \"If I will ask you, to run away with me... Would you?\"\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click the button below to download the app and search \"79577\"to continue reading the story.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'Mo-English-Books', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 115413681158429', 'page_likes': 44, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '115413681158429', 'ads_count': 42, 'cumulative_ads_count': 132, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:12:28', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed. I know what\\'s best for us and the pack. Can you imagine someone that\\'s banged by all the warriors being our Luna? You\\'d worry about every time she got pregnant, if it was ours or not .\"\\nZed shook his head. \"You\\'re going to regret this, Andy. You don\\'t know more than Selene does. It doesn\\'t matter how much pleasure you get from that woman, it will never be what we would experience with a real mate .\"\\nA soft knock on my door interrupted our discussion. Quinn pushed the door closed behind her and gave me a soft smile. \"Andy,\" she whispered .\\n\"Quinn,\" I greeted. I couldn\\'t take my eyes off her. She was wearing a high skirt that showed off her pale thighs. I couldn\\'t wait to feel those wrapped around me. \"You came .\"\\n\"You told me to, Alpha,\" she replied and bit her bottom lip. \"We\\'re really going to be mates, right?\"\\n\"Yeah, baby,\" I assured her. I went to her side and slipped my hand up her shirt. I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I\\'d waited long enough. Besides, ever since that rejection, there had been an ache inside me. I needed to fill it once and for all with the woman I\\'d chosen. Her smooth skin was what dreams were made of. \"Quinn,\" I moaned. I sucked on her shoulder and bit into her skin. I wasn\\'t marking her, not yet .\\n\"Andy,\" she moaned back .\\nI guided her to the bed and helped strip her blouse off. I threw it in the side of the corner and undid her bra, letting her breasts fall free. \"You\\'re gorgeous,\" I whispered. I straddled her and leaned down, taking one of her pretty pink nipples into my mouth and sucked hard on it until she squealed beneath me. The pain intensified but I had waited too long for this. Nothing was going to stop me. \"Take everything off,\" I ordered .\\nQuinn blushed and looked away from me. \"It\\'s embarrassing,\" she objected .\\nMy fingers went to her skirt, and I tugged the fabric down her legs and tossed it to the side until my beautiful Luna to be was beneath me in just her white silk panties. My fingers went to the hems, and I guided them off her until she was bare and beautiful. My entire head pounded. The stupid bond I\\'d rejected was determined to make me suffer. \"Spread your legs. I need to be inside you .\"\\nShe shifted on the bed, and she parted herself for me. I groaned. Lust beat through me like a drum. I took my own clothes off and let them join the growing pile. I climbed back up into my position and nudged her legs farther apart. I brushed my shaft against her and trembled. \"Andy,\" she whispered into my ear. \"I can\\'t wait to be yours .\"\\nI groaned. That\\'s all I needed .\\nMy door flew open, and I froze in place as Quinn shrieked and grabbed the sheet, hiding herself .\\n\"Andy Cain,\" my father, Alpha Dustins, the current Alpha growled my name like it was a curse word. \"We need to talk, now .\"\\nI didn\\'t even get a chance to apologize to Quinn and my mood wasn\\'t improved as Zed laughed his furry ass off at me .\\nWe\\'d see who got the last laugh. This wasn\\'t going to stop me. I\\'d already made my choice and nothing would change it .\\n\\nI\\'d only managed to grab a pair of pajama pants before I marched after my furious father. He didn\\'t take me to his war room where he made his Alpha decisions, but instead took me into his private study. He closed the door behind us and took a seat at his desk, looking at me over his interlocked hands .\\n\"What do you want?\" I growled at him. The lust that had formed with being with Quinn continued to surge through my body. I still wanted to return to her and finally get to shag her .\\n\"I want you to explain yourself .\" He replied cooly. He continued to stare at me with that judging glare of his. It was pretty rich that an Alpha that had slept with so many women was trying to give me a lecture about anything .\\n\"Well, Dad, you see before you rudely interrupted, I was about to bang my mate .\"\\nA darkness entered his eyes. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have been quite that mouthy. He was still the Alpha of this pack after all. \"Oh?\" he questioned me with a dark eyebrow lifted. \"Because that looked like Quinn Lotzel in your room. Not Sarah Gabriella .\"\\nWhat? How had dad known about Sarah? \"Sarah\\'s not my mate. Why would I ever be with a slag like that?\"\\nHe made a noise deep in the back of his throat. \"Regardless of what Sarah has or hasn\\'t\\' done, the fact remains that she is one of the best warriors this pack has ever had the privilege of possessing. Not only is she extremely skilled, but she has the talent capable of passing her skills on. While you\\'ve been gone, she\\'s been in charge of training the warriors .\"\\nI couldn\\'t resist. I laughed in his face. \"Seriously? She\\'s pathetic at that job then. I saw one of her warriors. That guy named Kale she bangs around with. He was pathetic and weak. We don\\'t need soft warriors like that .\"\\n\"That is the reason you rejected Sarah? You believe she\\'s been sleeping around with the pack?\"\\nA stray thought crossed my mind, and I leaned across the wide desk. \"You know, Dad, with how you keep defending her. You\\'ve got me suspicious. Have you been screwing her too? Why do you think she\\'s my mate anyway?\"\\nDad sighed. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Andy. While there wasn\\'t anyone around physically to see what you did, you forget that the school has high-tech cameras implemented all over it for the safety of our students. I watched you tear our greatest warrior apart several times. Imagine my surprise when I find you about to mate with another. Why did you choose Quinn? She has no pack standing, her family has no special background and her skills are lacking .\"\\nI laughed. \"Seriously? That\\'s your concerns?\" I rolled my shoulders and rotated my neck to relieve the pressure building through my body. I was so tired of this ache. The sooner I marked Quinn and made this official, the better. \"It doesn\\'t matter what Quinn is capable of. I am going to be the Alpha, I\\'m the one that runs the pack. All she has to do is stay hot for me and spit out some pups. That\\'s it. I\\'ll handle everything else .\"\\nMy father nodded as if he was actually listening to me. I seriously doubted that was the case. \"I\\'ve got a question for you, Andy. You\\'ve found your mate and rejected her. Why do you think that Quinn will not find her true mate and abandon you? You felt the power of the mate bond. It\\'s not so easily thrown to the side .\"\\nI curled my lip. \"It doesn\\'t matter. I know Quinn. I might be after her body, but she\\'s always been after my power. She\\'s always wanted to be the Luna of this pack. Nothing as simple as a mating bond is going to stop her from achieving her goal. She gets to be a Luna, guided by me, and I get the perfect little wife and the hottest wolf in this pack. It\\'s a great deal for both of us .\"\\n\"You\\'re making a mistake, son .\" Dad\\'s voice was heavy. \"I wished you hadn\\'t taken after me quite so much. The mate bond isn\\'t some afterthought granted by the Moon Goddess. She truly knows what we each need in life and how our mates are truly our other halves .\\nDid he really expect me to just sit here and listen to his nonsense? \"Dad, you can lecture me on mates when you learn to actually be faithful to one. All you\\'ve done is hurt mom for the entire time I\\'ve been born. I know what I\\'m doing with Quinn. I\\'m making her my Luna with or without your permission, and nothing is standing in my way .\"\\nHe shook his head at me. \"I\\'ll only allow you to have a bonding ceremony with Quinn on a couple of conditions .\"\\nI perked up. I had expected him to continue to deny me. \"Yeah? What is that?\"\\n\"You\\'re going to apologize to Sarah tomorrow .\"\\nI stared at him. \"What?\" I demanded. I didn\\'t want to have to even face her again. I wanted to forget she even existed. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\"As I\\'ve already told you. She is one of our strongest and most intelligent warriors. We don\\'t want her leaving the pack because of being heartbroken by you. She\\'s too great of an asset. You will apologize to her.\"\\n\"Whatever. I\\'ll do it if you\\'ll get off my back. What\\'s the other condition?\" What other humiliating task did this man have for me?\\n\"You won\\'t have sex with Quinn until your bonding ceremony. You are going to be the Alpha of this pack and you will act like it before I have to find someone else to lead it. Get control of your hormones and be a man .\"\\nI growled deep in my throat at his insults. Still, this would make it official. Quinn would be mine and no one would try to tear us apart. \"You\\'ve got a deal .\"\\nI headed for the door. I would have to apologize to Quinn and send her out of the house. If she stayed near me, I\\'d probably go back on my last promise .\\n\"Any, you really are going to regret this. You\\'ll understand soon how futile it is to defy our Goddess and why we follow her .\"\\nI slammed the door behind me. I didn\\'t need a lecture from him .\\nI knew exactly what I was doing and exactly the ending it would give me.\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n💋Click the “Download” button to download our app and search \"79354\",then you can read more exciting novels.', 'footer_text': 'APPS.APPLE.COM\\nContinue reading ➤➤\\nInstall Now', 'footer_action': 'Install Now', 'page_name': 'English-Fun2546', 'ad_occurance': 1, 'facebook_id': 'ID: 108350315163664', 'page_likes': 47, 'instgram_id': 'NO insta ID found', 'insta_followers': 0, 'static_id': '108350315163664', 'ads_count': 54, 'cumulative_ads_count': 106, 'days': '06/09/2022', 'date': '2022-09-06 22:12:45', 'hits': 1, 'search_term': 'smooth'}\n"

He didn\\'t even object when I kissed Quinn goodbye and told her to meet me in my room that night .\\nAfter all, why should we wait any longer? Neither of us had any bonds with anyone else, and we both knew what we wanted. Maybe she didn\\'t want me for myself and must my position, but I didn\\'t care. I was going to get what I\\'d wanted for years, what I\\'d lusted over and dreamed about. I was going to be her first .\\nThe instant I was home in my room, he finally acknowledged me .\\n\"Explain yourself, now, Andy .\" Zed\\'s hatred vibrated through our bond .\\n\"Are you going to listen to me about it? Or are you just going to be pissed without hearing my side?\"\\n\"Your side,\" Zed scoffed. \"All I can see is you wanted to shag Quinn so you didn\\'t care about our mate, our bond. You took who the Goddess had picked for us away. Do you now understand the consequences of your selfish actions?\"\\n\"Okay, cool, so you\\'re not going to listen to me. Whatever, Zed. It\\'s too late to change it now. I rejected her and nothing can undo that. Stop being a little bimbo and whining about it. I\\'m sure Quinn\\'s wolf is just as hot as she is .\"\\n\"That\\'s not the point,\" he growled at me. \"Anyway, I want your answer. What possible reason did you have to reject our mate? Explain or I\\'ll never let you have my full power .\"\\nI laughed at his pout. Did he really think he could cut me off like that? \"It\\'s simple, Zed. She\\'s a slag. You saw the proof today. I\\'ve heard the rumors. She\\'s got a body count of every warrior in the pack, except us and Jahmal .\" I frowned in thought. Had Jahmal ever slept with her? He was more of a waiting for his mate kind of guy, so I doubted it. Then again, Sarah could have tricked him .\\n\"Do you have proof?\" Zed demanded .\\n\"I just told you. She was in a locked room with that boy. Worthless warrior. Now that we\\'re back, we\\'re going to have to be a lot stricter on all of them. She probably let them get weak and skip out on vital exercises .\"\\nZed growled in agreement. \"Especially that one. Make him suffer, Andy .\"\\nI smirked. I had no doubts about that. \"Do you get it now? We don\\'t need to be with a loose woman like that. The Moon Goddess made a mistake pairing us with that. Trust me, Zed.
